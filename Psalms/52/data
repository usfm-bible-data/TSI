\c 52
\s1 Mazmur yang ditulis oleh Daud,
\s1 ketika Doeg, orang Edom itu memberitahukan Samuel
\s1 bahwa dia telah sampai di rumah Ahimelekh
\q1
\v 1 Mengapa engkau memegahkan diri, hai pahlawan?\add \add*
\q2 Kasih setia Allah tetap sepanjang masa.
\q1
\v 2 Engkau merancangkan yang jahat;
\q2 \add \add*hai engkau penipu, lidahmu tajam seperti pisau cukur.
\q1
\v 3 You like \add doing what is\add* evil more than you like doing what ,
\q1
\q2 and you like telling lies more than you like telling the truth.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 4 You who say things [MTY] to deceive people,
\q2 you like to say ◄things that hurt people/cruel things►!
\b
\q1
\v 5 But God will get rid of you forever;
\q2 he will grab you and drag you from your home
\q2 and take you away from this world where people are alive.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 6 When righteous people see that, they will be awestruck,
\q2 and they will laugh at \add what happened to\add* you, and say,
\q1
\v 7 “Look \add what happened to\add* the man who would not ask God to protect him;
\q2 he trusted that his great wealth \add would save him\add*;
\q2 he trusted in the money that he got by wickedly taking it from others!”
\b
\q1
\v 8 But I am \add secure/safe because I worship\add* in God's temple;
\q2 I am like a strong green olive tree.
\q1 I trust in God, who faithfully loves us forever.
\b
\q1
\v 9 God, I will always thank you for the things that you have done.
\q2 As I stand before godly people, I will proclaim that you are good (OR, the many good [MTY]\add things you have done for us\add*).
