\c 66
\s1 A psalm which is a song for the choir director
\q1
\v 1 \add Tell\add* everyone on the earth
\q2 that they should sing joyfully to praise God!
\q1
\v 2 They should sing songs that say that God [MTY] is very great,
\q2 and they should tell everyone that he is very glorious!
\q1
\v 3 They should say to God, “The things that you do are awesome!
\q2 Your power is very great,
\q2 with the result that your enemies ◄cringe/bow down► in front of you.”
\q1
\v 4 Everyone on the earth \add should\add* worship God
\q2 and sing to praise him
\q2 and honor him [MTY].
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 5 Come and think about what God has done!
\q1 Think about the awesome things that he has done among people.
\q1
\v 6 He caused the \add Red\add* Sea to become dry land,
\q2 with the result that our ancestors were able to walk right through it.
\q1 There we rejoiced because of what he \add had done\add*.
\q1
\v 7 He rules forever by his power,
\q2 and he keeps watching all the \add pagan\add* nations \add to see what evil things theydo\add*,
\q2 so those nations that want to rebel \add against him\add* should not be proud.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 8 You people \add of all nations\add*, praise our God!
\q2 Praise him loudly in order that people will hear you as you praise him.
\q1
\v 9 He has kept us alive,
\q2 and he has not allowed us to ◄stumble/be defeated►.
\b
\q1
\v 10 God, you have tested us;
\q1 you have allowed us to experience great difficulties \add to make our lives becomepure\add*
\q2 as people put precious metals in a hot fire \add to burn out what isimpure\add* [MET].
\q1
\v 11 Engkau menyebabkan kami jatuh ke dalam perangkap,
\q2 Engkau membiarkan kami menderita.
\q1
\v 12 Engkau membiarkan kami dikalahkan dan ditindas oleh musuh, dan kami telah mengalami kesusahan yang bagaikan bencana api dan air;
\q1 tetapi akhirnya Engkau membawa kami ke tempat yang [berkelimpahan//aman].
\b
\q1
\v 13 I will bring to your temple offerings that are to be completely burned\add on the altar\add*;
\q2 I will offer to you what I promised.
\q1
\v 14 When I was experiencing much trouble, I said that I would bring offerings to you\add if you rescued me\add*;
\q2 \add and you did rescue me, so\add* I will bring to you what I promised.
\q1
\v 15 I will bring sheep to be burned on the altar,
\q2 and I will also sacrifice bulls and goats,
\q2 and when they are burning, \add you will be pleased when\add* the smoke\add rises up\add* ◄\add to you/to the sky\add*►.
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 16 Marilah, kalian yang [takut dan hormat kepada//menyembah//setia terhadap] Tuhan, dengarlah!
\q2 Aku akan memberitahukan apa yang dilakukanNya kepadaku.
\q1
\v 17 Aku telah berseru minta pertolongan kepadaNya,
\q2 dan dengan mulutku aku puji Dia.
\q1
\v 18 If I had ignored the sins that I had committed,
\q2 the Lord would not have paid any attention to me.
\q1
\v 19 But because \add I confessed my sins\add*, God has listened to me
\q2 and he paid attention to my prayers.
\q1
\v 20 I praise God
\q2 because he has not ignored my prayers
\q2 or stopped faithfully loving me.
