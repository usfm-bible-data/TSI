\q1
\v 7 He rules forever by his power,
\q2 and he keeps watching all the \add pagan\add* nations \add to see what evil things theydo\add*,

\q2 as people put precious metals in a hot fire \add to burn out what isimpure\add* [MET].
\q1
\v 11 Engkau menyebabkan kami jatuh ke dalam perangkap,
\q2 Engkau membiarkan kami menderita.
\q1
\v 12 Engkau membiarkan kami dikalahkan dan ditindas oleh musuh, dan kami telah mengalami kesusahan yang bagaikan bencana api dan air;
\q1 tetapi akhirnya Engkau membawa kami ke tempat yang [berkelimpahan//aman].
\b
\q1
\v 13 I will bring to your temple offerings that are to be completely burned\add on the altar\add*;

\q1

\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 16 Marilah, kalian yang [takut dan hormat kepada//menyembah//setia terhadap] Tuhan, dengarlah!
\q2 Aku akan memberitahukan apa yang dilakukanNya kepadaku.
\q1
\v 17 Aku telah berseru minta pertolongan kepadaNya,
\q2 dan dengan mulutku aku puji Dia.
\q1
\v 18 If I had ignored the sins that I had committed,
\q2 the Lord would not have paid any attention to me.
\q1
\v 19 But because \add I confessed my sins\add*, God has listened to me
\q2 and he paid attention to my prayers.
\q1
\v 20 I praise God
\q2 because he has not ignored my prayers
\q2 or stopped faithfully loving me.
