\s1
\s1
\q1
\v 1 Kasihanilah aku, ya Allah;
\q2 sebab orang-orang menginjak-injak aku.
\q2 Sepanjang hari mereka menyerang aku. 
\q1
\v 2 Musuh-musuhku menginjak-injak aku sepanjang hari;
\q2 sebab banyak orang sombong yang menyerang aku.
\q1
\v 3 Ketika aku takut,
\q2 aku percaya kepada-Mu.
\q1
\v 4 Aku akan memuji firman-Mu, ya Allah;
\q2 aku tidak takut sebab aku percaya kepada-Mu.
\q2 Apakah yang dapat manusia perbuat terhadapku?
\b
\q1
\v 5 Sepanjang hari mereka mengacaukan perkataanku;
\q2 mereka selalu berpikir yang jahat terhadapku.
\q1
\v 6 Mereka hendak membuat perselisihan,
\q2 mengawasi langkahku,
\q2 \add \add*seolah-olah mereka ingin membunuh aku.
\b
\v 7 So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing;
\q2 show that you are angry by defeating those people!
\q1
\v 8 You have counted all the times that I have been wandering alone/distressed;
\q2 it is as though you have put all my tears in a bottle
\q2 \add in order that you can see how much I have cried\add*.
\q2 \add You have counted my tears and written\add* the number in your book.
\b
\q1
\v 9 When I call out to you, my God, my enemies will be defeated;
\q2 I know that will happen, because you are fighting for me.
\q1
\v 10 I praise/thank you that you do what you have promised;
\q2 Yahweh, I will always praise you for that [DOU].
\q2
\v 11 I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid.
\q2 I know that humans cannot really [RHQ] harm me!
\b
\q1
\v 12 I will bring to you the offering that I promised;
\q1 I will bring an offering to you to thank you,
\q1
\v 13 because you have rescued me from being killed;
\q2 you have kept me from stumbling.
\q2 Ordinary humans certainly cannot [RHQ] harm me!
\q2 As a result, I will continue to live in your presence in the light that\add shines on those who are still\add* alive (OR, in the light that\add enables people to\add* live).
