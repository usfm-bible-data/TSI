\q1
\v 1 Ya Allah, aku berseru kepada-Mu!
\q2 Dengarlah doaku!

\q2 Aku berseru kepada-Mu.
\q1 Tuntunlah aku ke tempat yang kokoh dan aman.

\v 3 You have been my refuge;
\q2 you have been like a strong tower [MET]
\q2 \add in which I am safe\add* from being attacked by my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Allow me to live close to your temple all during my life [HYP]!
\q1 Allow me to be safe [MET], \add like a little bird is safe\add* under\add its mother's\add* wings.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 5 God, you heard me when I solemnly promised \add to give offerings toyou\add*;

\b
\q1
\v 6  \add I am\add* the king \add of Israel\add*;
\q1 please allow me to live \add and rule\add* for many years,
\q2 and allow my descendants to rule also.

\v 7 Allow us to rule forever while you observe us;
\q2 watch over us while you faithfully love us and do for us what you promised.
\b
\q1
\v 8 If you do that, I will always sing to praise you [MTY]
\q2 while I offer to you each day the sacrifices that I promised to give to you.
