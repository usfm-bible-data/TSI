\s1 Mazmur yang ditulis Daud untuk Kondektur
\q1
\v 1 Dengarkanlah keluhanku, Ya ALLAH.
\q2 Lindungilah aku dari serangan musuh yang mengancam nyawaku.
\q1
\v 2 Sembunyikanlah aku dari rencana orang-orang jahat,
\q2 dari kumpulan para pembuat kejahatan.
\q1
\v 3 Lidah-lidah mereka tajam seperti sebuah pedang;
\q2 kata-kata mereka pahit seperti panah,
\q1
\v 4 untuk menjatuhkan orang dari tempat tersembunyi.
\q2 Dengan tiba-tiba mereka memanahnya dan tidak takut akan adanya pembalasan.
\q1
\v 5 They encourage each other about doing the evil things that they are planning to do;
\q2 they talk \add with each other\add* about where they can set traps to catch people,
\q2 and they think, “No one [RHQ] will see what we are doing,
\q1
\v 6 because we have planned very well the crime that we are going to commit!”
\q2 No one can fully understand what people can think and plan in their inner beings!
\b
\q1
\v 7 But \add it will be as though\add* God will shoot his arrows at them,
\q2 and suddenly they will be wounded.
\q1
\v 8 Because of what they say [MTY], he will get rid of them,
\q2 and then everyone who sees \add what has happened to\add* them will shake their heads\add to ridicule them\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 9 And then everyone will be afraid \add to sin because of what might happen to them,also\add*;
\q2 they will tell others what God has done,
\q2 and they themselves will think much about it.
\q1
\v 10 Righteous people should rejoice because of what Yahweh \add hasdone\add*;
\q2 they should go to him to ◄find protection/be safe►;
\q1 and all those who are godly will praise him.
