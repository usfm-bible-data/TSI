\q1
\v 1 TUHAN, Allah Yang Mahakuasa berfirman,
\q1 Dia memanggil semua orang,
\q2 dari timur sampai ke barat.
\q2
\v 2 Dari Sion, kota yang paling indah,
\q2 Dia memancarkan sinar kemualiaan-Nya.
\q1
\v 3 Dia datang untuk kita,
\q2 bukan dalam suatu keheningan.
\q1 Api yang besar mendahului kedatangan-Nya,
\q2 dan angin ribut yang sangat dahyat mengelilingin-Nya.
\q1
\v 4 Dia memanggil langit dan bumi
\q2 untuk menyaksikan pengadilan-Nya.
\q1
\v 5 Kata-Nya, “Kumpulkanlah orang-orang yang setia kepada-Ku,
\q2 yaitu mereka yang mengikat perjanjian dengan Aku dengan kurban sembelihan.”
\q1
\v 6 Lalu para malaikat di surga berseru,
\q2 “Allah sungguh adil,
\q2 Dialah Hakim Yang Agung.”
\qr (Think about that!)
\b
\q1
\v 7 God says, “My people, listen!
\q2 You Israeli people, listen,
\q1 as I, your God, say what you have done that is wrong.
\q1
\v 8 I am not rebuking you for making sacrifices to me,
\q2 for the offerings that you completely burn \add on the altar\add*.
\q1
\v 9 But I do not really need the bulls from your barns
\q2 and the goats from your pens \add that you sacrifice\add*,
\q1
\v 10 because all the animals in the forest belong to me,
\q2 and all the cattle on a thousand hills also belong to me.
\q1
\v 11 I \add own and\add* know all the birds
\q2 and all the creatures that move around in the fields.
\q1
\v 12 So, if I were hungry, I would not tell you \add to bring me somefood\add*,
\q2 because everything in the world belongs to me!
\q1
\v 13 I do not eat the flesh of the bulls \add that you sacrifice\add*,
\q2 and I do not drink the blood of the goats \add that you offer tome\add*.
\q1
\v 14 The sacrifice \add that I really want is that\add* you thank me
\q2 and do all that you have promised to do.
\q1
\v 15 And pray to me when you have troubles.
\q2 If you do that, I will rescue you, and then you will praise me.
\q1
\v 16 But I say this to the wicked people:
\q1 ◄Why do you/It does not benefit you at all to► [RHQ] recite my commandments
\q2 or talk about the agreement that I made with you,
\q1
\v 17 because you have refused to allow me to discipline you,
\q2 and you have rejected what I told you to do.
\q1
\v 18 Every time that you see a thief, you become his friend,
\q2 and you spend much time with those who commit adultery.
\q1
\v 19 You are always talking [MTY] about doing wicked things,
\q2 and you are always trying to deceive people.
\q1
\v 20 You are always accusing members of your own family
\q2 and slandering them.
\q1
\v 21 You did all those things, and I did not say anything to you,
\q2 so you thought that I was \add a sinner\add* just like you.
\q1 But now I rebuke you and accuse you, right in front of you.
\b
\q1
\v 22 So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this,
\q1 because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces,
\q2 and there will be no one to rescue you.
\q1
\v 23 The sacrifice that truly honors me is to thank me \add for what I havedone\add*;
\q2 and I will save those who always do the things that I want them to.”
