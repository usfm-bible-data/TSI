\s1 Mazmur Daud
\s1 Untuk kondektur; menurut nada “bunga Lili”
\q1
\v 1 Lepaskanlah aku, Ya ALLAH,
\q2 karena maut sedang mengancamku.
\q1
\v 2 Aku seperti tenggelam di lumpur yang dalam,
\q2 yang tidak berdasar;
\q1 Aku seperti ada dalam air yang dalam,
\q2 yang arusnya menenggelamkanku.
\q1
\v 3 Aku terlalu lelah untuk meminta pertolongan;
\q2 Tenggorokanku kering;
\q1 Mataku sembab mencari-cari ALLAHku.
\q1
\v 4 Mereka yang membenciku tanpa alasan lebih banyak jumlahnya dari rambut di kepalaku.
\q1 Musuhku yang ingin menghancurkanku tanpa alasan, melebihi aku.
\q1 Mereka menuduhku melakukan kejahatan yang tidak pernah kulakukan!
\q1
\v 5 Ya ALLAH, Engkau menyadari kebodohan-kebodohanku;
\q2 kesalahanku tidak tersembunyi dari-Mu.
\q1
\v 6 Jangan biarkan mereka yang mengandalkan-Mu dipermalukan karena aku,
\q2 Ya TUHAN dan raja yang berkuasa!
\q1 Jangan biarkan mereka yang mencari-Mu mendapat malu karena aku,
\q2 Ya ALLAH Israel!
\q1
\v 7 Karena aku menanggung malu demi nama-Mu,
\q2 sungguh-sungguh dipermalukan aku.
\q1
\v 8 Even my own \add older\add* brothers act as if they do not know me;
\q2 they treat me like a foreigner.
\q1
\v 9  \add Some people have despised your temple\add*;
\q2 but my zeal for keeping your temple \add holy\add* is like a fire burning inside me.
\q1 So \add it is as though\add* those who are insulting you are also insulting me.
\q1
\v 10 When I have humbled myself and ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►
\q2 \add to show my sadness about the disgraceful things that they have done to yourtemple\add*,
\q2 they just insult me.
\q1
\v 11 When I put on \add rough\add* sackcloth \add to show that I amsad\add*,
\q2 they laugh at [IDI] me.
\q1
\v 12 Even the elders \add of the city\add* say bad things about me.
\q2 The drunkards of the city sing \add disgusting\add* songs about me.
\b
\q1
\v 13 But Yahweh, I will \add continue\add* praying to you.
\q1 At the time that you choose, answer me and rescue me
\q2 because of your faithfully loving me.
\q1
\v 14 Do not allow me to sink anymore in the mud.
\q1 Rescue me from those who hate me!
\q2 Lift me up out of these deep waters!
\q1
\v 15 Do not allow the floods to swirl around me,
\q2 do not allow the deep mud to swallow me;
\q2 keep me from sinking into the pit \add of death\add* [MET].
\q1
\v 16 O Yahweh, answer my prayer and help me
\q2 because you are good and love me faithfully,
\q1
\v 17 Do not ◄hide yourself from/refuse to hear► me;
\q1 answer me quickly
\q2 because I am in great trouble.
\q1
\v 18 Come near to me and save me;
\q1 rescue me from my enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 19 You know that I am insulted
\q2 and that people cause me to feel ashamed and dishonored;
\q1 you know who all my enemies are.
\q1
\v 20 Their insults have deeply offended me,
\q2 and I ◄feel helpless/am in despair►.
\q1 I searched for someone who would pity me,
\q2 but there was no one.
\q1 I wanted someone to encourage/comfort me,
\q2 but there were none.
\q1
\v 21  \add Instead\add*, they gave me food \add that tasted like\add* poison,
\q2 and when I was thirsty, they gave me sour wine to drink.
\b
\q1
\v 22 I hope/desire that the feasts [MTY] \add that they enjoy\add* will ◄become a snare for/bring trouble to► them,
\q2 and that \add those whom they invite to\add* the sacrificial feasts will also be trapped.
\q1
\v 23 I hope/desire that their eyes will become dim so that they cannot see anything,
\q2 and that their backs/bodies will become weaker and weaker.
\q1
\v 24 Show them that you are very angry with them!
\q2 Because of your great/furious anger, chase after them and catch them.
\q1
\v 25 Cause their towns to become abandoned/deserted
\q2 and that there will be no one to live in their tents/houses.
\q1
\v 26  \add Do this\add* because they persecute those whom you have punished,
\q2 ◄they talk about the sins of/they want to hurt even more► those whom you have wounded.
\q1
\v 27 Keep making a record of all their sins,
\q2 do not acquit/pardon them \add for the evil things that they havedone\add*.
\q1
\v 28 Erase their names [SYN] from the book \add containing the names of those who haveeternal\add* life;
\q2 do not include them in the list of righteous people.
\b
\q1
\v 29 As for me, I have pain and am suffering.
\q2 O God, protect me and rescue me.
\b
\q1
\v 30 When God does that, I will sing as I praise God,
\q2 and I will honor him by thanking him.
\q1
\v 31 My doing that will please Yahweh more than \add sacrificing\add* oxen,
\q2 more than offering him full-grown bulls.
\q1
\v 32 Oppressed/Afflicted people will see \add that God has rescuedme\add*,
\q2 and they will be glad.
\q1 I desire that all you who request God \add to help them\add* will be encouraged.
\q1
\v 33 Yahweh listens to those who are needy;
\q2 He does not ignore/forget those who are oppressed/imprisoned.
\b
\q1
\v 34 I desire that everything will praise God—
\q2 everything that is in heaven and on earth, and all the creatures that are in the seas.
\q1
\v 35 God will rescue the people of Jerusalem \add from their enemies\add*,
\q2 and he will rebuild the towns that are in Judah.
\q1 His people will live there and again possess the land.
\q1
\v 36 The descendants of his people will inherit it,
\q2 and those who love him will live there \add safely\add*.
