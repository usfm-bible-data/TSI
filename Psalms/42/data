\c 42
\s1 Mazmur yang ditulis oleh Daud,
\s1 untuk pemimpin biduan, nyanyian pengajaran bani Korah 
\q1
\v 1 Seperti rusa yang merindukan air sungai,
\q2 demikian juga jiwaku merindukan Engkau, ya Allah.
\q1
\v 2 I desire to have fellowship with [MET] you, the all-powerful God.
\q2 \add I say to myself\add*, “When will I be able to go \add back to the temple inIsrael\add*
\q2 and worship in your presence again?”
\q1
\v 3 Every day and every night I cry;
\q2 the only thing I have to drink is my tears;
\q1 and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me,
\q2 “Why does your god not \add help you\add*?”
\q1
\v 4 I am very distressed [IDI] as I remember
\q2 when I went with the crowd of people to the temple \add in Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 leading them as we walked along;
\q1 we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God \add for what he haddone\add*;
\q2 we were a large group who were celebrating.
\b
\q1
\v 5 So \add I say to\add* myself, “◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]
\q1 I confidently expect God \add to bless me\add*,
\q2 and again I will praise him,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.”
\b
\q1
\v 6 But now, \add Yahweh\add*, I am very discouraged [IDI],
\q2 so I think about you.
\q1 \add You are there in Israel\add* where the Jordan \add River\add* rushes down from the bottom of Hermon\add Mountain\add* and Mizar Mountain.
\q1
\v 7 But here, the great sorrow that I feel is like water that you send down [MET];
\q2 it is like a waterfall that tumbles down and floods over me.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh shows me each day that he faithfully loves me,
\q2 and each night I sing to him
\q2 and pray to him, the God who causes me to live.
\b
\q1
\v 9 I say to God, who is like a huge rock \add under which I canhide\add* [MET],
\q1 “◄Why have you forgotten me, with the result that I ‘mourn/cry’ constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me?/It seems that you have forgotten me, with the result that I ‘mourn/cry’ constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me.►” [RHQ]
\q1
\v 10 They make fun of me constantly;
\q2 they continually ask, “Why does your god not help you?” [RHQ]
\q1 And when they insult me \add like that\add*,
\q2 \add it is like\add* wounds that shatter/smash my bones.
\b
\q1
\v 11 But \add I say to\add* myself,
\q2 “◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]
\q1 I will confidently expect God \add to bless me\add*,
\q2 and I will praise him again,
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.”
