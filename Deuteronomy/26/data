\c 26
\s1 Persembahan pada saat panen
\p
\v 1 "Setelah kamu memasuki negeri yang diberikan TUHAN, ALLAH kita, dan kamu tinggal di sana,
\v 2 kalian harus mengambil beberapa hasil panen pertama dari tanah yang diberikan TUHAN kepadamu, memasukkannya ke dalam keranjang, dan membawanya ke tempat yang akan dipilih TUHAN untuk menyembahNya di sana.
\v 3 Pergilah kepada Imam besar yang melayani pada saat itu dan katakan kepadanya, "Dengan memberimu bagian pertama dari panen saya hari ini, saya menyatakan kepada ALLAH, TUHAN kita, bahwa saya telah ditempatkan TUHAN di tanah yang telah dijanjikanNya kepada nenek moyang kami untuk di berikan kepada kami."
\v 4 Kemudian imam harus mengambil sekeranjang makanan dari tanganmu dan meletakkannya di atas mezbah di mana korban dipersembahkan kepada TUHAN, ALLAH kita.
\v 5 Kemudian di hadapan ALLAH, kalian harus berkata: "Nenek moyang kami Yakub adalah seorang pria dari Aram yang terus-menerus mengembara dari satu tempat ke tempat lain. dia membawa keluarganya ke Mesir. Mereka adalah kelompok kecil \ add ketika mereka pergi ke sana \ add *, tapi mereka tinggal di sana dan keturunan mereka menjadi negara yang sangat besar / terpadat [DOU] dan negara yang kuat.
\v 6 Then the people of Egypt acted very harshly [DOU] toward them, and they forced them to become their slaves and to work very hard.
\v 7 Then our ancestors cried out to you, Yahweh our God, and you heard them. You saw that they were suffering, and that they were forced to work very hard, and were being oppressed.
\v 8 Then by your great power [MTY] and by performing many kinds of miracles [DOU], and other terrifying things, you brought them out of Egypt.
\v 9 You brought us to this land and gave it to us, a land that is very fertile [IDI].
\v 10 So now, Yahweh, I have brought to you the first part of the harvest from the land that I received.’ Then you must set the basket down in Yahweh's presence and worship him there.
\v 11 And you must celebrate \add by eating a meal together to thank\add* Yahweh our God for all the good things that he has given to you and to your family. And you must invite the descendants of Levi and the foreigners who are living among you toalso rejoice \add and eat\add* with you.
\s1 The tithes
\p
\v 12 Every third year, you must bring to the descendants of Levi and to the foreigners\add who are living among you\add* and the orphans and the widows ◄a tithe/10 percent► of your crops, in order that in every town they will have plenty to eat.
\v 13 Then you must say to Yahweh, ‘I have brought to you, from my house, all of the sacred tithe\add from my harvest this year\add*. I am giving it to the descendants of Levi, to the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, as you commanded us to do. I have not disobeyed any of your commands\add about the tithes\add*, and I have not forgotten any of your commands\add about tithes\add*.
\v 14 \add I declare that\add* I have not eaten any food from the tithe while I was mourning\add for someone who died\add*. And I have not taken any of it \add out of myhouse\add* while I was unacceptable to you; I have not offered any of it to\add spirits of\add* dead people. Yahweh, I have obeyed you and done everything that you have commanded us\add concerning the tithe\add*.
\v 15 So \add please\add* look down from your holy place in heaven, and bless us, your Israeli people. Also bless this very fertile [IDI] land which you have given to us, which is what you promised our ancestors that you would do.’
\s1 Yahweh's own people
