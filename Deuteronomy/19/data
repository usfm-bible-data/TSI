\c 19
\s1 Kota-kota Perlindungan
\p
\v 1 “Sesudah TUHAN Allah kita menyingkirkan bangsa-bangsa dari negeri yang akan diberikan-Nya kepada kalian, dan sesudah kalian mengusir mereka dari kota-kota mereka dan mulai menetap di rumah-rumah mereka,
\v 2-3 haruslah kalian bagi menjadi tiga bagian negeri yang TUHAN berikan kepada kalian.  Lalu pilihlah sebuah kota di setiap bagian tersebut.  Jalan menuju ke kota itu haruslah kalian buat agar mudah bagi orang-orang untuk pergi ke sana. Seseorang yang membunuh orang lain bisa melarikan diri ke salah satu kota itu untuk meminta perlindungan.
\p
\v 4 Inilah aturan tentang seseorang yang membunuh orang lain.  Jika seseorang dengan tidak sengaja/tanpa direncanakan membunuh orang lain yang bukan musuhnya, dia boleh melarikan diri ke salah satu kota itu dan meminta perlindungan di sana.
\v 5 Contohnya, jika dua orang pergi masuk ke hutan untuk memotong pohon, dan kemudian mata kapak yang seorang copot dari gagangnya sementara dia menebang pohon, dan mata kapak itu mengenai temannya dan membunuhnya, orang yang memakai kapak yang copot itu diijinkan untuk lari ke salah satu kota itu dan menyelamatkan dirinya, sebab orang-orang di kota itu akan melindungi dia.
\v 6 Karena dia tidak dengan sengaja membunuh seseorang, dan karena orang itu bukanlah musuhnya, dia bisa mencoba lari ke salah satu kota itu. Jika hanya ada satu kota saja, mungkin akan jauh jaraknya ke kota itu.  Maka ketika saudara orang yang terbunuh, atau orang yang memiliki hak membalas dendam, sangat marah, orang itu mungkin bisa menangkap orang yang membunuh sebelum dia tiba di kota itu.
\v 7  Agar hal tersebut tidak terjadi, maka kalian harus memilih tiga kota, dan bukan hanya satu saja, agar seseorang dapat tiba di salah satu kota itu dengan cepat.
\p
\v 8-9 If you do everything that I am today commanding you to do, and if you love Yahweh our God, and if you conduct your lives as he wants you to do, Yahweh our God will give you much more land than you will have when you first occupy it, which is what he promised to do. He will give you all the land which he promised your ancestors that he would give to you. When he gives youthat land, you must select three more cities \add to which people mayescape\add*.
\v 10 Do this in order that people who ◄are innocent/have killed someone else without planning to► will not die, and you willnot be guilty for \add allowing\add* them to be executed, in the land that Yahweh is giving to you.
\p
\v 11 But suppose someone hates his enemy and hides and waits for that person\add to come along the road\add*. Then \add when he passes by, suddenly\add* he attacks him and murders him. If the attackerflees to one of those cities \add to be protected there\add*,
\v 12 the elders of the city \add where the murdered man lived must not protect theattacker\add*. They must send someone to the city to which the other man escaped, and bring him to [MTY] the relative who is supposed/expected to get revenge, so that he may execute that man.
\v 13 You must not pity those who murder other people! Instead, you must\add execute them\add*, in order that the people in the land of Israel will not be murder [MTY] innocent people, and in order that things will go well for you.
\s1 Warning against moving boundaries
\p
\v 14  \add When you are living\add* in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, do not move the markers of your neighbors' property boundaries which were placed there long ago.
\s1 Warnings about witnesses
\p
\v 15 If someone is accused of committing a crime, one ◄witness/person who says, ‘I saw him do it’► is not enough. There mustbe at least two ◄witnesses/people who say, ‘We saw him do it’►. \add If there is only onewitness\add*, the judge must not believe that what he says is true.
\p
\v 16 If someone tries to do wrong to another person by falsely accusing him,
\v 17 both of them must go to the place where the people worship, to\add talk to\add* the priests and judges who are serving at that time.
\v 18 The judges must ◄investigate the case carefully/try to find out which one is telling the truth►. If\add the judges determine that\add* one of them has accused the other falsely,
\v 19 that person must be punished in the same way that the other one would have been punished\add if the judge decided that he ◄was guilty/had done what is wrong►\add*. By punishing such people, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.
\v 20 And/Because when that person is punished, everyone will hear what has happened, and they will be afraid, and no one will dare to act that way anymore.
\v 21 You must not pity people who are punished like that. The rule should be that a person who has murdered someone else must be executed; one of a person's eyes must be gouged out if he has gouged out someone else's eye, one tooth of a person who has knocked out the tooth of another person must be knocked out; one hand of a person who has cut off the hand of another person must likewise be cut off; one foot of a person who has cut off the foot of another person must also be cut off.”
