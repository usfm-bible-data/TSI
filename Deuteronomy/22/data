\s1 Various other laws
\p
\v 1 “Apabila kamu melihat sapi atau domba saudaramu tersesat, janganlah kamu pura-pura tidak tahu, tetapi bawalah binatang itu kembali kepada pemiliknya.
\v 2 Apabila kamu tidak tahu siapa pemiliknya, bawalah binatang itu ke rumahmu. Dan kalau pemiliknya datang untuk mencarinya, kembalikanlah binatang itu kepadanya.
\v 3 Perbuatlah demikian juga dengan keledainya, pakaiannya dan segala barang milik saudaramu yang kamu temukan. Janganlah kamu berpura-pura tidak tahu.
\p
\v 4 Apabila kamu melihat keledai atau sapi saudaramu rebah di jalan, janganlah berpura-pura tidak tahu, tetapi tolonglah saudaramu itu membangunkan binatang itu kembali.
\p
\v 5 Perempuan [tidak boleh//dilarang keras] memakai pakaian laki-laki, dan sebaliknya laki-laki [tidak boleh//dilarang keras] memakai pakaian perempuan. TUHAN Allahmu sangat membenci orang yang [melakukan hal seperti itu//melanggar larangan itu].
\p
\v 6 Apabila kamu menemukan sarang burung di dahan pohon atau di tanah yang induknya sedang mengerami telurnya atau induknya sedang bersama-sama dengan anak-anaknya, janganlah kamu mengambil induk burung itu.
\v 7 Kamu boleh mengambil anak-anak burung itu, tetapi induknya kamu biarkan [terbang//bebas]. Dengan demikian TUHAN akan memberkatimu dan memberimu umur panjang.
\p
\v 8 Jika kamu mau membangun sebuah rumah baru, maka kamu harus memasang pagar di sekeliling atap rumah itu. Dengan demikian, bila ada orang yang jatuh dari atap itu lalu mati, maka kamu [bebas//tidak bertanggungjawab atas kecelakaan itu].

\s1 Aturan tentang pernikahan
\p
\v 13 Apabila seorang laki-laki menikahi seorang perempuan dan sudah melakukan hubungan seks selayaknya suami istri, kemudian laki-laki itu tidak menginginkannya lagi,
\v 14 dan menuduh istrinya itu [bukan perawan lagi//pernah bersetubuh dengan laki-laki lain] sebelum dia menikahi perempuan itu.
\v 15 If that happens, the young woman's parents must take the sheet that was on the bed when that man and their daughter were married, which still has bloodstains on it, and show it to the elders of the city at the ◄gate of/central meeting place in► the city.
\v 16 Then the father of the young woman must say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife. But now he says that he doesn't want her anymore.
\v 17 And he has falsely said that she was not a virgin when he married her. But look! Here is what proves that my daughter was a virgin! Look at the bloodstains on the sheet where they slept the night that they were married!’ And he will show the sheet to the elders.
\v 18 Then the elders of that city must take that man and whip him.
\v 19 They shall require that he pay a fine of 100 pieces of silver and give the money to the father of the young woman, because the man caused an Israeli young woman to be disgraced. Also, that woman must continue to live with him; she is his wife. He is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.
\p
\v 20 But if what the man said is true, and there is nothing to prove that she was a virgin when he married her,
\v 21 they must take that young woman to the door of her father's house. Then the men of that city must execute her by throwing stones at her. They must do that because she has done something in Israel that is very disgraceful, by having sex with some man\add while she was still living\add* in her father's house. By executing her like that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.
\p
\v 22 If a man is caught while he is having sex with another man's wife, both of them must be executed. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from Israel.
\p
\v 23 Suppose in some town a man sees a young woman who is engaged/promised to be married to another man, and he is caught having sex with [EUP] her.
\v 24 You must take both of them to the ◄gate of/central meeting place in► that town. There you must execute them both by throwing stones at them. You must execute the young women because she did not shout for help even though she was in the town. And the man must be executed because he had sex [EUP] with someone who was already engaged/promised to be married. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.
\p
\v 25 But suppose out in the open countryside a man meets a young woman who is engaged/promised to be married, and he rapes her. If that happens, only that man must be executed.
\v 26 But you must not punish the young woman, because she did not do anything for which she deserves to be executed. This caseis like when one man attacks another man \add in the countryside\add* and murders him,
\v 27 because the man who raped her saw her when she was in the open countryside, and even though she called out for help, there was no one there who could rescue her.
\p
\v 28 If a man rapes a young woman who is not engaged/promised to be married, if someone sees him while he is doing that,
\v 29 that man must pay 50 pieces of silver to the young woman's father, and he must marry her, because he forced her to have sex with him. He is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.
\p
\v 30 A man must not disgrace his father by having sex with any of his father's wives.”
