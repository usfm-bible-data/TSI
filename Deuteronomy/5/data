\c 5
\s1 Moses repeated for them the Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 Saya memanggil kalian semua orang Israel untuk menyampaikan seluruh peraturan TUHAN kepadamu, supaya kalian mendengar dan menaatinya.
\v 2 Jadi ingatlah apa yang dikatakan TUHAN, ketika kita berada di Gunung Sinai, yaitu TUHAN Allah kita membuat satu kesepakatan dengan kalian.
\v 3 Bukan hanya dengan orang tuamu.Tapi termasuk dengan kita yang masih hidup sekarang.
\v 4
\v 5 On that day, I stood between your ancestors and Yahweh to tell them what he said, because they were afraid of the fire, and they did not climb up the mountain. This is what Yahweh said:
\mi
\v 6 ‘I am Yahweh your God, the one you \add worship\add*. I am the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt. I am the onewho freed you from being slaves \add there\add*.
\li1
\v 7 \add You must worship only\add* me; you must not worship any other god.
\li1
\v 8 You must not carve/make for yourselves any idol that represents anything in the sky or anything that is on the ground or anything that is in the water under the ground/earth.
\li1
\v 9 You must not bow down to any idol and worship it, because I am Yahweh God, and I ◄am very jealous/want you to worship me only►. I punish those who sin and hate me. I punish not only them, but I will punish ◄their descendants, down to the third and fourth generation/their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren►.
\v 10 But I will steadfastly love ◄thousands of generations/all the descendants► of those who love me and obey my commandments (OR, I will love for thousands of generations).
\li1
\v 11 Do not use/speak my name carelessly (OR, for wrong/evil purposes), because I am Yahweh God, the one whom you\add should worship\add*, and I will certainly punish those who use/speak my name for wrong/evil purposes [LIT].
\li1
\v 12 Do not forget that the seventh day \add of every week\add* is mine. Dedicate those days to me just like I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you.
\li1
\v 13 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 14 but the seventh day is a rest day, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not tell foreigners to work, those who are living in your country. You must allow your slaves to rest on that day just like you do.
\v 15 Do not forget that you were slaves in Egypt, and that I, Yahweh your God, brought you out from there by my very greatpower. [DOU, MTY] That is the reason that I am commanding that \add allof\add* you must rest on the seventh/Sabbath day \add each week\add*.
\li1
\v 16 Honor/Respect your fathers and your mothers, just like I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you, in order that you may live a long time in the land that I, Yahweh your God, will give you, and in order that things will go well for you there.
\li1
\v 17 Do not murder anyone.
\li1
\v 18 Do not ◄commit adultery/have sex with anyone other than your spouse►.
\li1
\v 19 Do not steal anything.
\li1
\v 20 Do not tell lies about anyone \add when you are speaking in acourt\add*.
\li1
\v 21 Do not ◄covet/desire to have► someone else's wife, someone else's house, someone else's fields, someone else's male slave or female slave, someone else's livestock, someone else's donkeys, or anything else that another person owns.’
\p
\v 22 Those are the commandments that Yahweh spoke to your ancestors. When they were gathered there at\add the bottom of\add* the mountain, he spoke with a very loud voice from the middle of the fire, and there were dark cloudssurrounding the mountain. He spoke only those \add ten\add* commandments, no more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
\p
\v 23 After your ancestors heard \add Yahweh's\add* voice when he spoke to them out of the darkness, while there was a big fire burning on the mountain, their leaders and elders came to me,
\v 24 and \add one of\add* them said, ‘Listen to us! Yahweh our God showed us that he is very great and glorious when we heard him speak [MTY] from the fire. Today we have realized that it is possible for us humans to continue to live even though God has spoken to us.
\v 25 But we are afraid that we will die [RHQ] if we hear Yahweh our God speak [MTY] to us again; his terrible fire will destroy/kill us.
\v 26 ◄Who has/Certainly no human has► remained alive after hearing the all-powerful God speak [MTY] to them from a fire.
\v 27 \add So Moses\add*, you go up the mountain and listen to everything that Yahweh our God will say. Then\add come back and\add* tell us everything that he has said, and we will listen to what he has said and obey it.’
\p
\v 28 Yahweh heard your leaders say that, so \add when I went back up themountain\add*, Yahweh said to me, ‘I have heard what your leaders have said, and what they have said is right/correct.
\v 29 I surely wish that they would always think like that and have an awesome respect for me and obey all my commandments, in order that things may go well for them and for their descendants forever.
\p
\v 30 So go \add down\add* and tell them to return to their tents.
\v 31 But \add then you come back up here and\add* stand near me, and I will give to you all the rules and regulations that I\add want them to obey\add*. Then you can teach them to the people, in order that they will obey them when they are in the land that I am giving to them.’
\p
\v 32 \add So I went back down to the people, and I said to them\add*, ‘Be sure that you do everything that Yahweh our God has commanded us to do. Do not disobey any of his laws.
\v 33 Conduct your lives as Yahweh our God has commanded us to do, in order that you may live a long time, and in order thatthings will go well for you \add when you are living\add* in the land that you will occupy.’ ”
