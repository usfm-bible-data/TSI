\c 28
\s1 Berkat dari Tuhan
\p
\v 1 Jika kamu mendengarkan suara Tuhan, Allahmu, dan dengan setia melakukan semua perintah yang telah saya sampikan kepadamu hari ini, maka Tuhan, Allah akan menjadikanmu bangsa yang besar daripada bangsa lain di bumi ini.
\p
\v 2 Segala berkat ini akan datang kepadamu dan menjadi milikmu jika kamu mendengarkan suara Tuhan, Allahmu:
\pi1
\v 3 Tuhan memberkati semua yang kamu kerjakan, memberkatimu disaat berada di kota dan memberkatimu disaat bekerja di ladang.
\pi1
\v 4 Diberkati buah [rahimmu//kandunganmu] dengan memberimu banyak anak;
\pi1 diberkati tanahmu dengan memberimu hasil panen yang berlimpah;
\pi1 dan diberkati hasil ternakmu yaitu: lembu sapimu dan kandungan dombamu.
\pi1
\v 5 Diberkati hasil panen gandummu dan makanan yang kamu buat dari gandum tersebut.
\pi1
\v 6 Diberkati dimanapun kamu berada- ketika masuk rumahmu dan ketika keluar rumahmu.
\pi1
\v 7 Tuhan menyerahkan musuh-musuhmu yang bangkit melawanmu, dan semuanya kalah dihadapanmu;
\pi1 dari satu arah mereka datang menyerangmu, tetapi lewat tujuh arah mereka akan lari dari hadapanmu.
\pi1
\v 8 Tuhan memerintahkan berkat-Nya turun atasmu [lumbung//gudang penyimpanan] gandummu dan atas semua yang dikerjakan tanganmu;
\pi1 Tuhan, Allah akan memberkatimu di tanah yang diberikan-Nya kepadamu.
\p
\v 9 Jika kamu mematuhi perintah Tuhan, Allahmu, dan [hidup//berjalan] di jalan yang ditetapkan-Nya, Dia akan menjadikanmu [umat yang kudus//umat-Nya] seperti yang Dia janjikan.
\p
\v 10 Semua bangsa di bumi ini melihat bahwa kamu umat [pilihan//yang dipanggil] Tuhan dan bangsa-bangsa itu akan [menghormati//menakuti] kamu.
\p
\v 11 Tuhan akan melimpahimu dengan semua kebaikan di tanah yang sudah dijanjikan-Nya diberikan kepada nenek moyangmu. Dia akan memberkati [rahimmu//kandunganmu], memberkati hasil ternakmu dan memberimu hasil [tanah//panen] yang melimpah.
\p
\v 12 Pada saat kamu membutuhkan hujan, Tuhan akan menurunkannya dari langit untuk tanahmu. Tuhan akan memberkati semua yang dikerjakan tanganmu, sehingga kamu bisa memberi pinjaman untuk bang lain, sedangkan kamu tidak meminjam dari mereka.
\p
\v 13-14 Jika dengan setia kamu melakukan perintah Tuhan, Allahmu, yang sudah saya sampaikan kepadamu hari ini dan tidak menyimpang ke kanan dan ke kiri dan tidak menyembah allah lain;
\p Tuhan akan menjadikanmu pemimpin di antara bangsa-bangsa lain, bukan pengikut dan kamu senantiasa berhasil dalam segala hal dan tidak pernah gagal.
\s1 Kutuk dari Tuhan
\p
\v 15 Tetapi jika kamu tidak mendengar suara Tuhan, Allahmu, dan tidak melakukannya dengan setia sesuai dengan perintah dan hukum yang saya berikan kepadamu hari ini, maka segala kutuk ini akan datang kepadamu dan menimpamu:
\pi1
\v 16 Dia akan mengutuk semua yang kamu kerjakan,
\pi1 mengutuk kamu disaat berada di kota dan mengutuk kamu disaat bekerja di ladang.
\pi1
\v 17 Terkutuklah tanaman gandummu dengan tidak memberimu hasil panen yang banyak dan terkutuk makanan yang kamu buat dari gandum tersebut.
\pi1
\v 18 Terkutuklah buah [rahimmu//kandunganmu] dengan tidak memberimu banyak anak, terkutuk tanahmu dengan tidak memiliki hasil panen yang banyak, dan terkutuk ternakmu dengan sedikit ternak lembu sapi dan domba.
\pi1
\v 19 He will curse you \add everywhere\add*—when you go out of \add yourhouses\add* and when you come into \add your houses\add*.
\p
\v 20 If you do evil things and reject Yahweh,
\pi1 he will curse you by causing you to ◄be confused/not know what to do►, and to be frustrated in all that you do,
\pi1 until \add your enemies\add* quickly and completely destroy you {you will be quickly and completely destroyed}.
\pi1
\v 21 Yahweh will send terrible diseases on you,
\pi1 until not one of you remains alive in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.
\pi1

\pi1 All these things will strike you until you die.
\pi1
\v 23 No rain [MET] will fall from the sky, \add with the resultthat\add* the ground will be \add as hard as\add* iron [MET].
\pi1
\v 24 Instead of sending rain, Yahweh will send strong winds to blow sand and dust over your land, until your land is ruined.
\pi1
\v 25 Yahweh will enable your enemies to defeat you;
\pi1 your soldiers will attack them from one direction, but they will run away from them in seven/many directions,
\pi1 and when the people of other nations see what is happening to you, they will say that it is horrible.
\pi1
\v 26  \add You will die\add*, and birds and wild animals will come and eat your corpses,

\pi1
\v 27 Yahweh will cause you to have boils on your skin, like he caused the people of Egypt to have\add many years ago\add*.

\pi1
\v 28 Yahweh will cause \add some of\add* you to become insane; he will cause some of you to become blind, and he will cause\add some of\add* your minds to become confused.
\pi1
\v 29  \add Because you will not be able to see where you are going\add*, at midday you will ◄grope/feel your way► around with your hands, like people do in the darkness.
\pi1 You will not prosper in anything that you do.
\pi1 You will continually be oppressed and robbed, and there will not be anyone to help you.

\pi1 They will drag away your donkeys while you watch them do it, and they will not give them back to you.
\pi1 They will take away your sheep; and there will not be anyone to help you\add rescue them\add*.
\pi1
\v 32 While you watch, your sons and daughters will be given to foreigners to become their slaves. Every day you will watch for your children to return, but ◄you will watch in vain/they will never return►.
\pi1
\v 33 People from a foreign nation will take all the crops that you worked hard to produce,
\pi1 and they will constantly treat you harshly and cruelly [DOU].
\pi1
\v 34 The result will be that all these terrible things that you see/experience will cause you to become insane.
\pi1
\v 35 Yahweh will cause your legs \add to be covered with\add* painful boils that cannot be healed,
\pi1 and you will have boils from the bottoms of your feet to the tops of your heads.
\pi1
\v 36 Yahweh will cause your king and the rest of you to be taken to another country, to a place in which you and your ancestors have never lived,
\pi1 and there you will worship and serve gods that are made of wood or stone.
\pi1
\v 37 When the people-groups in nearby countries see what has happened to you, they will be shocked/horrified;
\pi1 they will taunt/ridicule [IDI] you and make fun of you.
\pi1
\v 38 You will plant plenty of seeds in your fields, but you will reap only a small harvest, because locusts will eat the crops.
\pi1
\v 39 You will plant grapevines and take care of them, but you will not pick any grapes to make wine, because worms will eat the vines.
\pi1
\v 40 Olive trees will grow everywhere in your land, but you will not get any olive oil to rub on your skin because the oliveswill drop on \add the ground before they are ripe\add*.
\pi1
\v 41 You will have sons and daughters, but they will not stay with you, because they will be captured and taken away.
\pi1
\v 42 Swarms of locusts/insects will eat your crops and \add the leavesof\add* all your trees.

\v 43 Foreigners who live in your land will become more and more\add powerful\add*, and you will become less and less \add powerful\add*.
\pi1
\v 44 They will have \add money\add* to lend to you, but you will not have any money to lend to them.
\pi1 They will be superior [IDI] to you, and you will be inferior to them [IDI].
\p
\v 45 All these disasters will happen to you and continue to happen to you until you are destroyed, if you do not do what Yahweh your God told you to do, and do not obey all the rules and regulations that he gave to you.
\p
\v 46 These disasters will solemnly warn [DOU] you and your descendants forever\add about what happens to groups who disobey Yahweh\add*.
\p
\v 47 Because Yahweh blessed you abundantly in many ways, you should have served him very joyfully [DOU], but you did not do that.
\p
\v 48 Therefore, you will work for the enemies whom Yahweh will send to attack you. You will be hungry and thirsty; you will not have clothes to wear; and you will lack everything else that you need. And Yahweh will cause you to become slaves [MET] and work hard until he gets rid of you.
\p
\v 49 Yahweh will bring against you an army from very far away [HYP], soldiers who speak a language that you do notknow/understand. They will swoop down on you \add quickly\add* like an eagle [SIM].
\v 50 They will be fierce-looking. They will not act mercifully toward anyone, not even young children and old people.
\v 51 They will \add kill and\add* eat your livestock, and they will eat your crops, and you will ◄starve/die because you do not have anything to eat►. They will not leave for you any grain or wine or\add olive\add* oil or cattle or sheep; and you will all die \add fromhunger\add*.
\v 52 Your enemies will surround your towns throughout the land that Yahweh your God is about to give to you, and they willbreak down the high and strong walls \add around your towns\add*, walls which you trusted/thought would protect you.
\p
\v 53 When your enemies are surrounding \add your towns\add*, you will be extremely hungry, with the result that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters that Yahweh your God has given to you.
\v 54-55 When your enemies have surrounded your towns, even the most gentle and sensitive men among you will want food verydesperately, with the result that they will \add kill their own childrenand\add* eat their flesh, because they will not have anything else to eat. They will not even share any of it with their brothers or wives whom they love very much or with any of their children who are still alive.
\v 56-57 Even the most gentle and sensitive/kind women among you, who are very refined/rich with the result that they have never been forced to walk anywhere [HYP], will do the same thing. When your enemies have surrounded your towns, those women will be extremely hungry, with the result that after they give birth to a child, they will secretly\add kill the baby and\add* eat its flesh and also eat the afterbirth. And they will not share any of it with their husbands whom they love very much or with any of their other children.
\p
\v 58 If you do not faithfully obey all of the laws that I am writing, and if you do not have an awesome respect for Yahweh our glorious God [MTY],
\v 59 he will \add punish you by\add* sending on you and on your descendants great afflictions and plagues which will last for many years.
\v 60 He will bring on you the plagues that he sent on the people of Egypt, and you will never be healed.
\v 61 He will also send on you many other sicknesses and diseases that I have not talked about in these laws, until you all will die.
\v 62 You became as numerous as the stars in the sky, but only a few of you will remain alive, if you do not obey Yahweh your God.
\v 63 Yahweh was very happy to do good things for you and to cause you to become very numerous, but now he will be happy toruin you and get rid of you. \add Those of you who do not die from theseplagues\add* will be snatched away from the land that you will soon be entering to possess.
\p
\v 64 Yahweh will scatter you among many people-groups, all over the earth, and in those areas/places you will serve other gods that are made of wood or stone, gods which you and your ancestors have never known/worshiped.
\v 65 In those areas you will not have any peace/safety or rest. Yahweh will cause you to be constantly worried/anxious, feel hopeless, and be discouraged.
\v 66 You will always be afraid that your enemies will kill you. You will be very fearful, all day and all night.
\v 67 Because you will be very fearful/afraid and because you will\add very distressed\add* because of the \add terrible\add* things that you see, each morning you will say ‘I wish it were evening already!’ and each evening you will say ‘I wish it were morning already!’
\v 68 Yahweh will send \add some of\add* you back to Egypt in ships, even though he promised that you would never\add be forced to\add* go there again. There in Egypt you will try to sell yourselves to become slaves of your enemies\add in order to have food to eat\add*, but no one will buy you.\add All those things will happen to you if you do not obey the laws that Yahweh is giving toyou\add*.”
