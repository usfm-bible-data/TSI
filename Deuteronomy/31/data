\c 31
\s1 Musa menunjuk Yosua untuk menggantikannya
\p
\v 1 Setelah Musa selesai mengatakan semua itu kepada orang-orang Israel,
\v 2 Musa berkata kepada mereka, "Sekarang saya berumur 120 tahun. Saya tidak kuat untuk memimpin kalian lagi. TUHAN juga telah mengatakan kepada saya bahwa saya tidak bisa menyeberangi sungai Yordan lagi.
\v 3 Tapi ALLAH TUHAN kita akan menyertai kamu. Dia akan menghancurkan bangsa-bangsa yang tinggal di sana, agar kalian dapat menempati tanah mereka. Yosua yang akan memimpin kalian, itulah yang TUHAN katakan kepadaku.
\v 4 TUHAN akan menghancurkan bangsa dan negeri itu seperti Dia menghancurkan orang Sihon dan Og, raja-raja orang Amori.
\v 5 TUHAN akan menolong kalian untuk menaklukkan bangsa-bangsa itu, tapi kalian harus membunuh semua bangsa-bangsa itu, itulah yang telah saya perintahkan untuk kalian lakukan.
\v 6 Jadilah pemberani dan percaya diri. Jangan takut dengan orang-orang itu. Ingatlah bahwa ALLAH TUHAN kita yang akan menyertai kalian. Dia pasti akan selalu membantu kalian dan tidak akan pernah meninggalkan kalian. "
\p
\v 7 Lalu Musa memanggil Yosua, pada saat semua orang Israel mendengarkan, saya berkata kepadanya, "Jadilah berani dan percaya diri. kamulah yang akan memimpin orang-orang ini ke negeri yang dijanjikan TUHAN kepada nenek moyang kita yang akan diberikannya kepada mereka, dan kamu akan memungkinkan mereka untuk menguasainya.
\v 8 It is Yahweh who will go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will always help [LIT] you. He will never abandon you. So do not be afraid or dismayed.”
\s1 The laws are to be read periodically
\p
\v 9 Moses/I wrote down all these laws and gave \add the scroll\add* to the priests, who carried the chest containing the Ten Commandments, and to all the Israeli elders.
\v 10 Moses/I told them, “At the end of every seven years, at the time that all debts are canceled,\add read this to the people\add* during the Festival of \add Living inTemporary\add* Shelters.
\v 11 Read it to all the Israeli people when they gather at the place that Yahweh chooses for them to worship him.
\v 12 Gather together everyone—men, women, children, even the foreigners\add who are living\add* in your towns—in order that they may hear\add these laws\add* and learn to have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God, and to faithfully obey everything that is written in these laws.
\v 13 \add If they do that\add*, your descendants who have never known these laws will hear them and will also learn to have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God, during all the years that they live in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan\add River\add* to occupy.”
\s1 Moses predicted their disobedience
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen carefully. You will soon die. Summon Joshua, and you go to the Sacred Tent withhim, in order that I may appoint him \add to be the new leader\add*.” So Joshua and Moses/I went to the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 15 There Yahweh appeared to them/us in a pillar of cloud, and that cloud was close to the door of the tent.
\v 16 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “You will soon die [EUP]. Then these people will become unfaithful [MET] to me. They will abandon me and ◄break/stop obeying► the agreement that I made with them. They will begin to worship the foreign/pagan gods\add that are worshiped by the people\add* of the land that they will enter.
\v 17 When that happens, I will become very angry with them. I will abandon them [DOU] and I will no longer help them [IDI], and I will destroy them {they will be destroyed}. Many terrible things will happen to them, with the result that they will say,\add ‘We are certain that\add* [RHQ] these things are happening to us because our God is no longer with us.’
\v 18 And because of all the evil things that they will have done, and\add especially because\add* they will have started to worship other gods, I will refuse to help [IDI] them.
\p
\v 19 So, \add I am going to give you\add* a song. Write it \add on ascroll\add* and teach it to the Israeli people and cause them to memorize it. It will be like a witness that accuses them.
\v 20 I am about to take them into a very fertile [IDI] land, a land that I solemnly promised their ancestors that I would give to them. There they will have plenty to eat, with the result that\add their stomachs\add* will \add always\add* be full and they will become fat. But then they will turn to other gods and start to worship them, and they will despise me and ◄break/stop obeying► the agreement that I made with them.
\v 21 And many terrible disasters will happen to them. After that happens, their descendants will remember this song, and itwill be like a witness that says \add ‘Now you know why Yahweh punished yourancestors\add*.’ I will soon take them into the land that I solemnly promised that I would give to them; but now, before I dothat, I know what they are thinking \add that they will do when they are livingthere\add*.”
\v 22 So on the day that \add Yahweh gave Moses/me this song\add*, he/I wrote it down, and he/I taught it to the Israeli people.
\p
\v 23 Then Yahweh ◄appointed/set apart► Joshua and said to him, “Be brave and confident, because you will lead the Israeli people into the land that I solemnly promised that I would give to them. And I will be with you.”
\p
\v 24 Then Moses/I finished writing on a scroll all the laws that Yahweh had told to him/me.
\v 25 Then Moses/I told the descendants of Levi, who were carrying the Sacred Chest that contained the Ten Commandments,
\v 26 “Take this scroll on which these laws \add are written\add*, and place it beside the Sacred Chest that contains the agreement that Yahweh our God made with you, in order that it may remain there to testify about what\add Yahweh will do\add* to the people \add if they disobey him\add*.
\v 27 \add I say this\add* because I know that these people are very stubborn [DOU]. They have rebelled against Yahweh allduring the time that I have been \add with them\add*, and they will rebel much more after I die!
\v 28 So gather all the elders of the tribes and your officials, in order that I can tell them the words\add of this song\add*, and request all those who are in heaven and on the earth to be witnesses to testify against these people.
\v 29 I say that because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked. They will turn away from doing all that I have commanded them to do. And in the future, because of all the evil things that they will do, they will cause Yahweh to become angry with them. And he will cause them to experience disasters.”
\s1 The song that Moses sang to them
\p
\v 30 Then, while all the Israeli people listened, Moses/I sang/recited this entire song to them:
