\c 17
\s1 Peringatan mempersembahkan kurban binatang cacat
\p
\v 1 “Janganlah mengurbankan kepada TUHAN Allah kita ternak atau domba atau kambing yang cacat, sebab TUHAN membenci persembahan seperti itu.”
\s1 Hukuman untuk Penyembahan Berhala
\p
\v 2 “Ketika kalian tinggal di kota manapun di negeri yang TUHAN Allah kita berikan kepada kalian, seandainya ada beberapa laki-laki atau perempuan yang berdosa karena tidak menaati perjanjian yang TUHAN sudah buat dengan kalian.
\v 3 Misalkan orang tersebut menyembah dan melayani allah lain, atau matahari, atau bulan ataupun bintang-bintang.
\v 4 Jika seseorang memberitahu kalian bahwa beberapa orang sudah melakukan hal tersebut, kalian haruslah menyelidikinya dengan seksama.  Jika kalian mendapati bahwa benar hal menjijikan tersebut sudah terjadi di Israel,
\v 5 haruslah kalian bawa keluar mereka yang menyembah allah lain itu. Lalu kalian harus melemparkan batu kepada mereka untuk membunuh mereka.
\v 6 Tetapi kalian diijinkan untuk menghukum orang-orang itu hanya jika setidaknya ada dua orang saksi yang menyatakan bahwa mereka melihat orang-orang itu melakukan penyembahan kepada allah lain.  Orang-orang itu tidaklah boleh dihukum hanya atas dasar kesaksian satu orang saja.
\v 7 Para saksi yang melihat mereka menyembah allah lain haruslah menjadi yang pertama melemparkan batu kepada si pelaku penyembah allah lain itu.  Lalu yang lain haruslah melemparkan batu-batu kepada mereka.  Dengan melakukan demikian, kalian menyingkirkan praktek kejahatan ini dari antara kalian.”
\s1 Menyidang kasus-kasus sulit
\p
\v 8 “Terkadang sangat sulit untuk para hakim memutuskan apa yang sebenarnya terjadi. Sometimes it will be very difficult for the judges to decide what really happened. He might be trying to decide whether, when someone injured or killed another person, he did it accidentally or deliberately. Or he might be trying to decide if some person is sueing another person unfairly. If in some town it is very difficult to know what really happened, with the result that the judge cannot decide it, you should go to the place that Yahweh our God has chosen for you\add to worship him\add*.
\v 9 There you should present the case to the descendants of Levi who are the priests, and to the judge who is serving at that time, and they should decide what should be done.
\v 10 After they make their decision, you must do what they tell you to do.
\v 11 Accept what they have decided, and do what they say that you should do. Do not try to change in any way what they have decided [IDI].
\v 12 You must execute anyone who proudly/arrogantly disobeys the judge or the priest who stands there in the presence ofYahweh \add and decides what should be done\add*. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.
\v 13 Then/Because \add after that person is executed\add*, all the people will hear about it, and they will be afraid, and none of them will act that way anymore.”
\s1 Proper behavior for a king
\p
\v 14 “\add I know that\add* after you have occupied the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, and you are living there, you will say, ‘We should have a king to rule over us, like the kings that other nations around us have.’
\v 15 Yahweh our God will permit you to have a king, but be sure that you appoint someone whom he has chosen. That man must be an Israeli; you must not appoint someone who is a foreigner to be your king.
\v 16  \add After he becomes the king\add*, he should not acquire a large number of horses for himself. He should not send people to Egypt to buy horses for him, because Yahweh said to you, ‘Never return to Egypt\add for anything!’\add*
\v 17 And he must not have a lot of wives, because if he did that, they would turn him [SYN] away from\add worshiping only\add* Yahweh. And he must not acquire a lot of silver and gold.
\p
\v 18 When he becomes your king, he must \add appoint someone to\add* copy these laws. He must copy them from the scroll that is kept by the priests who are descended from Levi.
\v 19 He must keep this new scroll near him and read from it every day of his life, in order that he may learn to revere Yahweh, and to faithfully obey [DOU] all the rules and regulations\add that are written\add* in these laws.
\v 20 If he does that, he [SYN] will not think that he is ◄better/more important► than [IDI] his fellow Israelis, and he will completely obey [LIT] Yahweh's commands. As a result, he and his descendants will rule as kings in Israel for many years.”
