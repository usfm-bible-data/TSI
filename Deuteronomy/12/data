\c 12
\s1 Satu tempat untuk Menyembah
\p
\v 1 “Saya akan memberitahukan kalian peraturan-peraturan dan ketetapan-ketetapan yang haruslah kalian taati dengan setia di negeri yang TUHAN, Allah yang nenek moyang kita sembah berikan untuk kalian kuasai.  Kalian haruslah menaati semua hukum-hukum ini sepanjang waktu selama kalian hidup.
\v 2 Haruslah kalian hancurkan semua tempat di mana bangsa-bangsa yang akan kalian usir itu menyembah allah-allah mereka, di atas pegunungan dan bukit-bukit dan di bawah pohon-pohon yang hijau.
\v 3 Haruslah engkau meruntuhkan mezbah-mezbah mereka dan menghancurkan tiang-tiang keramat mereka.  Bakarlah patung-patung dewi Asyera dan belahlah dewa-dewa mereka yang terbuat dari kayu, agar tidak seorangpun akan pernah menyembah mereka di tempat-tempat itu lagi.
\p
\v 4 Janganlah menyembah TUHAN seperti bangsa-bangsa di Kanaan menyembah dewa-dewa mereka.
\v 5 Sebaliknya, haruslah kalian pergi ke tempat yang akan dipilih oleh TUHAN. Tempat itu akan ada di dalam wilayah di mana salah satu suku kalian akan hidup. Di tempat itulah kalian harus berdiam di hadapan TUHAN dan menyembah Dia.
\v 6 Di tempat itulah kalian harus membawa persembahan-persembahan kurban kalian yang akan dibakar habis di atas mezbah, persembahan persepuluhan dari hasil panen kalian, persembahan sukarela, dan kurban anak sulung dari ternak kalian.
\v 7 Di sanalah, di hadapah TUHAN Allah kita, yang telah begitu luar biasa memberkati kalian, kalian dan keluarga kalian akan makan hasil yang baik dari hasil kerja kalian, dan kalian akan bergembira.

\v 8  \add When you are in that land\add*, you must not do some of the things that we have been doing. Until now, you have allbeen worshiping \add Yahweh\add* the way you wanted to,
\v 9 because you have not yet arrived in the land which Yahweh is giving to you, where you will be able to live peacefully.
\v 10 But when you cross the Jordan \add River\add*, you will start to live in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you. He will protect you from all your enemies that will surround you, and you will live peacefully/safely.
\p
\v 11 Yahweh will choose one place where he wants you to worship him. That is the place to which you must bring all the offerings that I command you to bring: The sacrifices that must be completely burned\add on the altar\add*, your other sacrifices, other offerings that you yourselves decide to give, ◄your tithes/ten percent of all your crops►, and all the special offerings that you will solemnly promise to give to Yahweh.
\v 12 Rejoice there in the presence of Yahweh, along with your children, your male and female servants, and the descendants of Levi who live in your towns. Do not forget that the descendants of Levi will not have their own land, like you will have.
\v 13 Be sure that you do not offer sacrifices anywhere you want to.
\v 14 You must offer them only in the place that Yahweh will choose for you, in an area that belongs to one of your tribes. That is the only place where he wants you to offer sacrifices that will be completely burned\add on the altar\add*, and to do the other things that I am commanding you to do\add when you worship him\add*.
\p
\v 15 However, you will be permitted to kill and eat the meat of your animals in the places where you live. As often as you want to, you may eat the meat of the animals that Yahweh our God will bless you by giving them to you. Those who have done things that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done things like that may all eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.
\v 16 But you must not eat the blood \add of any animals\add*; you must let the blood drain onto the ground\add before you cook the meat\add*.
\v 17 In the places where you live, you must not eat the things that you are offering\add to Yahweh\add*: You must not eat the ◄tithes/ten percent► of your grain or of your wine, or of your\add olive\add* oil, or the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, or the offerings that you yourselves decide to give to Yahweh, or any other offerings.
\v 18 Instead, you and your children and your male and female servants and the descendants of Levi who live in your towns must eat those things in the presence of Yahweh in the place that he chooses. And you should be happy about everything that you have done.
\v 19 Be sure that you take care of the descendants of Levi all during the time that you live in your land.
\p
\v 20 When Yahweh our God gives you much more land \add than you will have when you first occupyit\add*, which is what he has promised to do, and you say ‘I would like some meat to eat’ because you are craving/wanting some meat, you are permitted to eat meat whenever you want to.
\v 21 If the place that Yahweh our God chooses to be the place for you to worship him is far\add from where you live\add*, you are permitted to kill some of your cattle or sheep that Yahweh has given to you, and you may eat that meat at the places where you live, just like I have told you to do.
\v 22 Those who have done things that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done things like that are permitted to all eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.
\v 23 But be sure that you do not eat the blood \add of any animal\add*, because it is the blood that sustains life in living beings, and so you must not eat the life along with the meat.
\v 24 Do not eat the blood; instead, let it drain onto the ground.
\v 25 If you obey this command and do what Yahweh says is right \add for you todo\add*, things will go well for you and for your descendants.
\p
\v 26 But the sacred offerings that Yahweh has told you to give and the other offerings that you yourselves decide to give, you must take to the place that Yahweh will choose.
\v 27 You must offer there the sacrifices that will be completely burned\add on Yahweh's altar\add*. You must also offer there the sacrifices from which you may eat some of meat after you\add kill the animals and\add* drain out the blood and some of it is thrown on the\add sides of the\add* altar.
\v 28 Faithfully obey all these things that I have commanded you. If you do that, things will go well forever for you and your descendants, because you will be doing what Yahweh our God says is right\add for you to do\add* and what pleases him.
\p
\v 29 When you enter the land that you will occupy, as you advance, Yahweh our God will get rid of the people-groups that live there.
\v 30 After he does that, be sure that you do not \add worship thegods\add* that they have been worshiping, because if you do that, it will be like a trap\add that will catch you\add* [MET]. Do not ask anyone about those gods, saying, ‘Tell me how they worshiped their gods, inorder that I can \add worship Yahweh\add* in the same way.’
\v 31 Do not try to worship Yahweh our God like they have worshiped their gods, because when they worship them, they dodisgusting things, things that Yahweh hates. \add The worst thing that they dois\add* that they sacrifice their own children and burn them \add on theiraltars\add*.
\p
\v 32 Be sure to do everything that I have commanded you to do. Do not add anything to these commands, and do not take anything away from them.”
