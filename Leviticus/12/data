\c 12
\s1 Menyucikan wanita setelah melahirkan
\p
\v 1 TUHAN juga berkata kepada Musa,
\v 2"Katakan kepada orang Israel: Jika seorang wanita melahirkan seorang anak laki-laki, dia menjadi najis selama tujuh hari sama seperti saat dia sedang haid setiap bulannya.
\v 3 Anak laki-laki harus disunat pada hari kedelapan setelah dia lahir.
\v 4 Kemudian wanita tersebut harus menunggu 33 hari untuk disucikan dari perdarahannya saat persalinan. Dia tidak boleh menyentuh apapun yang suci atau memasuki area Tenda Suci sampai saat itu berakhir.
\v 5 If a woman gives birth to a daughter, she must be avoided for two weeks, like she must be avoided when she is menstruating each month. Then she must wait 66 days to be purified from the bleeding\add that occurred when the baby was born\add*.
\p
\v 6 When that time for her to be purified is ended, that woman must bring to the priest at the entrance of the Sacred Tent aone year-old lamb to be completely burned \add on the altar\add* and a dove or a young pigeon\add to be sacrificed\add* to enable her to become acceptable to Yahweh again.
\v 7 The priest will offer them to Yahweh in order that she may be forgiven for any sins she has committed. Then she will bepurified from her flow of blood \add when the baby was born\add*.
\p Those are the regulations for women who give birth to a son or daughter.
\v 8 If a woman who gives birth to a child cannot afford a lamb, she must bring two doves or two young pigeons. One will beburned completely \add on the altar\add*, and one will be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to God again. By doing that, the priest will cause that she will be forgiven for any sins she has committed, and she no longer will need to be avoided.‚Äù
