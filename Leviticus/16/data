\s1 The Day of Atonement
\p
\v 1 Sesudah itu, dua anak laki-laki Harun meninggal karena mereka mempersembahkan kurban api yang mambuat TUHAN marah.
\v 2 TUHAN berfirman kepadanya, “Beritahukan kepada Harun kakak tertuamu, supaya ia jangan masuk sembarangan ke dalam kemah suci karena tempat itu sangat kudus dan AKU hendak menampakan diri di situ. Apabila ia melanggarnya maka akan langsung mati.
\p
\v 3 Apabila Harun hendak masuk ke dalam kemah suci, ia harus membawa satu ekor sapi jantan muda sebagai persembahan penghapus dosa dan satu ekor domba jantan muda untuk kurban bakaran.
\v 4 Katakan juga, bahwa ia harus mandi dan memakai pakaian mulai dari pakaian dalam, kemeja, celana dan ban pinggang semuanya harus berbahan lenan.
\v 5 Sedangkan orang-orang Israel harus membawa kepadanya dua ekor kambing jantan untuk dipersembahkan sebagai korban penghapus dosa dan satu ekor domba untuk dibakar sampai habis sebagai korban bakaran di meja persembahan.
\p
\v 6 Harun juga harus mempersembahkan satu ekor sapi jantan sebagai korban, supaya AKU akan mengampuni dosanya dan dosa keluarganya.
\v 7 Lalu, dia harus membawa dua ekor kambing jantan kepada TUHAN dan menaruhnya di depan pintu kemah suci.
\v 8 Harun harus menentukan pilihan dengan memakai batu terhadap dua ekor kambing jantan itu, satu batu untuk TUHAN dan satu bagi Azazel.
\v 9 Demikianlah, maka kambing yang telah dipilih Harun itu harus dimasak dan dipersembahkan kepada TUHAN sebagai korban penghapus dosa.
\v 10 Harun juga harus membawa juga kepadaKu kambing yang lain yang belum dibunuh. Kambing itu harus dilepaskan di padang sebagai lambang atas dosa orang-orang Israel yang telah dibuang jauh-jauh.
\p
\v 11 Sesudah itu, Harun harus membawa dan mempersembahkan satu ekor sapi jantan yang masih muda sebagai korban penghapus dosanya sendiri dan bagi keluarganya.
\v 12 Kemuddian dia harus membawa bara dalam tempat pembakaran dari mesbah dan dua kepal tangan kemenyan yang berbau harum, semuanya itu dibawa masuk ke dalam kemah suci.
\v 13 Kemenyan itu harus dibakar dan asapnya harus menutupi penutup peti perjanjdian yang berisi sepuluh perintah TUHAN, supaya dia tidak mati.
\v 14 Then he must dip his finger into \add the basin\add* and sprinkle some blood on the lid of the sacred chest, and also sprinkle some blood seven times against the front of the chest.
\p
\v 15 \add Aaron must then go outside the Sacred Tent\add*and slaughter the goat to be an offering for the sins of the people. Then he must bring its blood into the Very Holy Place behind the curtain. There he must sprinkle\add some of\add* that blood on the lid of the sacred chest and against the front of the chest, like he did with the bull's blood.
\v 16 By doing that, he will purify the Very Holy Place. And he must sprinkle more of the blood on the Sacred Tent, because the tent is in the midst of the camp of the Israeli people who have become unacceptable to me\add because of their sins\add*.
\v 17 When Aaron goes into the Very Holy Place \add in the SacredTent\add* to purify it, no one else is permitted to enter \add the other partof\add* the Sacred Tent. Only after Aaron has performed rituals to enable me to forgive him and his family, and all the Israeli people, is any priest permitted to enter the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 18 Then Aaron must go outside the tent to purify my altar. He must do this by smearing some of the blood from the bull and some of the blood from the goat on each of the projections at the corners of the altar.
\v 19 Then Aaron must dip his finger into the \add basin of\add* blood and sprinkle some of the blood over the altar seventimes. By doing that, he will cleanse it from being unholy \add because of thesins\add* of the Israeli people, and it will become holy again.
\p
\v 20 When Aaron has finished purifying the Very Holy Place \add inside the SacredTent\add* and all of the Sacred Tent and the altar, he must bring the goat that was chosen to be set free.
\v 21 He must put both of his hands on the head of the goat and confess all the sins [DOU] of the Israeli people. By doingthat, he will put \add the guilt of\add* their sins on the head of the goat. Then he must give the goat to a man who is chosen, and that man will send the goat out into the desert.
\v 22 \add It is as though\add* the goat will carry away into the desert\add the guilt for\add* the sins of all the people.
\p
\v 23 When Aaron approaches the Sacred Tent, he must take off the linen clothes that he wore when he\add previously\add* entered the Very Holy Place, and he must leave those clothes there.
\v 24 Then he must bathe in a sacred place, put on his regular/ordinary clothes, and sacrifice the animals that will be burned completely on the altar, for his own sins and for the sins of the Israeli people. By doing that he will enable me to forgive him and them.
\v 25 He must also burn on the altar all the fat of the two animals that were sacrificed.
\p
\v 26 The man who was chosen to send the goat into the desert and free it there must afterwards wash his clothes and bathe. Then he may return to the camp.
\v 27 The carcasses of the bull and the goat that were slaughtered to be an offering/sacrifice for the people's sins, whose blood was taken inside the Very Holy Place to enable Yahweh to forgive the Israeli people, must be carried outside the camp and burned. The hides/skins of the animals, the inner organs, and the dung must also be burned.
\v 28 The man who burns those things must then wash his clothes and bathe before he returns to the camp.
\p
\v 29 In ◄October/the month after the dry season ends►, on the day that I have appointed, you all must ◄fast/abstain from eating food► and not do any work. This is a rule/law that will never end. It must be obeyed by you people who have been Israelis all your lives, and also by foreigners who are living among you.
\v 30 On that day, Aaron will perform rituals to enable me to forgive you all, and then I will cleanse/free you all from\add the guilt of\add* all your sins and you will become acceptable to me.
\v 31 That will be a day for you to rest and not do any work, like the Sabbath days, and you must ◄fast/abstain from eating food► all that day. That is a permanent command/law for you all to obey.
\v 32 In future years, this ritual/ceremony to enable me to forgive you all [DOU] will be performed by the Supreme Priest whois anointed \add with olive oil\add* and appointed to serve instead of his ancestor Aaron. He must put on the sacred clothes made of linen
\v 33 and offer sacrifices to purify the Very Holy Place, all of the Sacred Tent, the altar, the priests, and all the Israelpeople \add like Aaron did\add*.
\v 34 This will be a permanent command/law for you to obey once every year, to enable me to forgive you Israeli people for the sins that you have committed.”
\p Moses/I obeyed all those instructions/commands that Yahweh had given to him/me.
