\c 5 Jenis-jenis dosa yang dilakukan yang harus mempersembahkan korban
\p
\v 1"Jika seseorang diminta menjadi saksi untuk sesuatu yang telah dilihat atau sesuatu yang telah di dengarnya, tetapi ia menolak mengatakan apa yang benar-benar ia ketahui, maka ia harus mendapat hukuman karena menolak untuk mengatakan apa yang dia ketahui.
\p
\v 2 Jika seseorang secara tidak sengaja menyentuh sesuatu yang najis, seperti bangkai binatang liar atau bangkai hewan, atau binatang yang mengeriap di sepanjang tanah, maka ia harus mendapat hukuman.
\p
\v 3 Jika seseorang tidak sengaja menyentuh apapun yang najis dari manusia, kemudian ia menyadarinya, ia harus membayar hukuman.
\p
\v 4 Jika seseorang dengan ceroboh bersumpah menambahkan untuk melakukan sesuatu \ add * itu bagus atau itu buruk, ketika Anda menyadari apa yang telah Anda lakukan, Anda harus membayar hukuman / hukuman .
\p
\v 5 If you are guilty of committing any of those sins, you must confess what you have done.
\v 6 And for a penalty you must bring to Yahweh a female lamb or female goat, to be an offering for the sin that you have committed, and the priest will sacrifice it, and then you will no longer be guilty for your sin.
\p
\v 7 If you \add are poor and\add* cannot afford to bring a lamb, you must bring to Yahweh two doves or two young pigeons. One will be an offering for your sin and one will be an offering that will be completely burned\add on the altar\add*.
\v 8 You must bring them to the priest. First he will offer one of them to be an offering for your sin. He will wring/twist itsneck \add to kill it\add*, but he must not pull off its head completely.
\v 9 Then he must sprinkle some of the blood against the side of the altar. The remaining blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. That will be an offering for your sin.
\v 10 The priest will then do what I have commanded and offer the other bird to be completely burned\add on the altar\add*. Then you will no longer be guilty for the sin you have committed, and Yahweh will forgive you.
\p
\v 11 However, if you \add are very poor and\add* cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, you must bring to be an offering for your sin ◄1 pound/1 kg.► of fine flour. You must not put olive oil or incense on it, because it is an offering for sin.
\v 12 You must take it to the priest. He will take a handful of it, to symbolize that the whole offering truly belongs to Yahweh, and burn it on the altar, on top of the other offerings.
\v 13 And by doing that, the priest will enable you to no longer be guilty for any of the sins that you have committed, and you will be forgiven. The part of the offering that is not burned will belong to the priest, like was true for the offerings made from grain.”
\s1 The guilt offering
\p
\v 14 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
\v 15 “When you sin, without intending to, by not giving to Yahweh the things that you are required to give to him, you must pay a penalty by bringing to Yahweh a ram that has no defects. You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official standard in the temple. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.
\v 16 But you must also make restitution for what you failed to give to Yahweh, adding one-fifth of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a sacrifice for the sin that you have committed and cause you to no longer be guilty; and you will be forgiven.
\p
\v 17 If you sin by doing something that is forbidden in any of Yahweh's commands, even if you do not know that you have disobeyed one of my commands, you are guilty and must pay a penalty\add to me \add*.
\v 18 \add When you realize what you have done\add*, you must bring a ram to the priest to be an offering in order that you will no longer be guilty. You must bring one that has no defects. The priest \add will offer the ram to be a sacrifice to me\add*, and as a result you will no longer be guilty for the sin that you have committed, and you will be forgiven.
\v 19 It is an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty for sinning against Yahweh.”
