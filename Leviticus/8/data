\c 8
\s1 Harun dan anak-anaknya [dilantik//diurapi] menjadi imam
\p
\v 1 TUHAN berbicara kepada Musa,
\v 2 “Panggillah Harun bersama dengan anak-anaknya, dan ambillah pakaian, minyak urapan, sapi jantan untuk kurban [pengampunan//penghapus dosa], 2 ekor domba jantan dan satu keranjang roti yang tidak beragi.
\v 3 Dan kumpulkanlah semua [masyarakat//umat] Israel di depan pintu Rumah-Ku.”
\v 4 Musa melakukan semua yang diperintahkan TUHAN kepadanya. Dan semua [masyarakat//umat] Israel berkumpul di depan pintu Rumah TUHAN.
\p
\v 5 Kemudian Musa berbicara kepada mereka, “Inilah perintah TUHAN yang harus kita lakukan.”
\v 6 Lalu Musa menyuruh Harun bersama anak-anaknya maju ke depan untuk [membersihkan//menyucikan] diri.
\v 7 Musa memakaikan kemeja putih, mengikatkan ikat pinggang kain dan memakaikan jubah dan baju efod serta ikat pinggang baju efod kepada Harun.
\v 8 Musa juga memakaikan tutup dada kepada Harun. Dia memasukkan Urim dan Tumim ke dalam tutup dada guna mengetahui kehendak Allah.
\v 9 Kemudian Musa mengikatkan serban pada kepala Harun. Pada bagian depan serban itu, Musa memasang hiasan emas berupa mahkota kudus seperti yang diperintahkan TUHAN kepada Musa.
\p
\v 10 Lalu Musa mengambil minyak urapan dan mengoleskan pada Rumah TUHAN dan semua peralatan yang ada di dalamnya. Dengan demikian Musa sudah menguduskan semuanya bagi TUHAN.
\v 11 Sebagian dari minyak urapan itu, Musa memercikkannya 7 kali di atas mezbah dan semua peralatan yang ada serta bejana pembasuhan dan alasnya untuk menguduskan semuanya bagi TUHAN.
\v 12 Sesudah itu, Musa mengurapi Harun dengan menuangkan minyak urapan di atas kepala Harun untuk menguduskannya.
\v 13 Selanjutnya, Musa meminta anak-anak Harun maju ke depan. Lalu Musa memakaikan kemeja putihThen he/I brought forward Aaron's sons. He/I put tunics/shirts on them, tied sashes/waistbands around them, and wrapped turbans around their heads, like Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
\p
\v 14 Then he/I brought the bull for the offering to cause people to be forgiven for the sins that have committed. Then Aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull's head.
\v 15 Then Moses/I slaughtered the bull, \add caught some of its blood in abowl\add*, and with his/my finger put some of it on the projections at the corners of the altar, to purify the altar. He/I poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. By doing that, he/I caused it to be a suitable place for burning sacrifices for sin.
\v 16 Moses/I took all the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal, including the liver and kidneys, and burned them on the altar.
\v 17 He/I took the rest of the bull, including the hide and intestines, and burned them outside the camp, like Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
\p
\v 18 Then he/I brought the ram for the offering that would be completely burned\add on the altar\add*, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
\v 19 Then Moses/I slaughtered the ram and sprinkled its blood on all sides of the altar.
\v 20-21 He/I cut the ram into pieces and washed the inner parts and hind legs.Then he/I put the head, the fat, and the other parts of the ram on the altar. As it burned, the aroma of the smoke was pleasing to Yahweh. It was an offering to Yahweh that was burned, as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
\p
\v 22 Then he/I brought the other ram, the one for consecrating the priests, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
\v 23-24 Moses/I slaughtered that ram, \add drained some of its blood in abowl\add*, and put some of that blood on the lobes of the right ears, the thumbs of the right hands, and the big toes of theright feet of Aaron and his sons \add to indicate that what they listened to and what they did and where they went should bedirected by Yahweh\add*.
\v 25 He/I picked up all the fat of the ram, its fat tail, the fat that covered the inner parts, including the fat that covered the liver and kidneys, and the right thigh of the ram .
\v 26-27 Then from the basket containing the bread that was made without yeast, the bread which had been dedicated to Yahweh,he/I picked up one loaf of bread \add made without olive oil\add*, and one loaf that was\add made by mixing the flour\add* with olive oil, and one wafer. He/I put those on top of the portions of fat, and put them into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they lifted them up in the presence of Yahweh\add to indicate that it was an offering that belonged to him\add*.
\v 28 Then Moses/I took those things from their hands and burned them on the altar. That was the offering that was burned to appoint Aaron and his sons as priests. And the aroma while it burned was pleasing to Yahweh.
\v 29 Moses/I also took the breast of the second ram and lifted it up, as Yahweh had commanded. The breast was Moses'/my share of the ram that was sacrificed to dedicate the priests.
\p
\v 30 Then Moses/I took some of the olive oil for anointing \add Aaron and hissons\add*, and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his sons and on their clothes. By doing that, he/I consecrated Aaron and his sons and their clothes.
\p
\v 31 Then Moses/I said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat \add of the secondram\add* at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket, like I told you to do.
\v 32 Burn up any of the meat and bread that remains.
\v 33 The time for you to be set apart as priests will be seven days, so do not leave the entrance of the Sacred Tent for seven days.
\v 34 What we have done today is what Yahweh commanded to cause that you will be forgiven for your sins.
\v 35 You must stay at the entrance of the Sacred Tent for seven days and seven nights and do what Yahweh requires, in orderthat you will not die \add because of disobeying him. I am telling youthat\add* because that is what Yahweh has commanded me to tell you.”
\p
\v 36 So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh told Moses/me to tell them.
