\v 1 Allah berbicara kepada Musa;
\v 2 Bicaralah kepada Harun dan anak-anaknya serta seluruh
\p orang Israel: “Inilah perintah Allah:
\p
\v 3 Setiap orang Israel baik dari masing-masing marga yang akan memotong korban sapi, domba, dan kambing kepada TUHAN, maka hewan-hewan korban itu harus dipotong di depan pintu Kemah Kudus TUHAN. Kalau hal itu dilakukan di tempat lain maka hal itu melanggar aturan dan harus dihukum.
\v 4 Apabila pemotongan hewan korban dilakukan di pintu kemah pertemuan dan darahnya tertumpah maka hal itu adalah pelanggaran dan orang itu harus dilenyapkan.
\v 5 Peraturan itu sebagai perintah kepada semua orang Israel yang akan mempersembahkan korban agar supaya jangan dilakukan di tempat
\p terbuka akan tetapi mereka wajib membawa persembahan itu kepada imam di depan pintu kemah TUHAN dan memotongnya di situ sebagai korban pendamaian.
\v 6  \add After the animal is slaughtered\add*, the priest must sprinkle some of its blood against the altar at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and burn its fat to be an aroma that is pleasing to me.
\v 7 You people must no longer give sacrifices to the demons that resemble goats which you are worshiping. You people must obey this command forever.’
\p
\v 8 And tell this to them: ‘If any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among them brings an offering that is to becompletely burned \add on the altar\add* or any other sacrifice
\v 9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the Sacred Tent \add area\add* to be a sacrifice to me, that person will no longer be allowed to associate with my people.
\p
\v 10 I will reject [IDI] any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among you who eats any blood, and I\add will command that he\add* no longer be allowed to associate with my people.
\v 11 That is because the life of every creature is in its blood; I have declared that it is blood that is to be offered on the altar to enable people to be forgiven for their sins.
\v 12 That is why I say that you Israelis must not eat blood, and the foreigners who live among you must also not eat blood.
\p
\v 13 Any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among you who hunts any animal or bird that is permitted for you to eat, mustdrain out the blood \add of the animal or bird that he kills\add* and cover the blood with dirt.
\v 14 This is because the life of every creature is in its blood. And that is why I have said [DOU] to you Israelis that anyonewho eats blood must no longer \add be allowed to associate with mypeople\add*.
\p
\v 15 Anyone in Israel, including foreigners, who eats any of the meat of any creature that is found dead, or that had been killed by wild animals, must wash his clothes and bathe. Then he must not touch anyone until that evening.
\v 16 If he does not do those things, he will be punished for what he did.’ ”
