\s1 Cara mengurus pelita
\p
\v 1 TUHAN berfirman kepada sayaYahweh also said to Moses/me,
\v 2 “Perintahkanlah umat Israel untuk tetap membawa minyak zaitun yang terbaik untuk pelita-pelita di kemah pertemuan agar pelita-petite itu tetapi menyala sepanjang hari. Command the Israeli people to continually bring to you clear oil made from pressed olives to burn in the lamps\add in the Sacred Tent\add*, in order that those lamps will burn all the time.
\v 3 Di bagian luar Ruang Maha Kudus, Harun harus mengurus pelita-pelita yang ada di hadapan-Ku supaya lampu-lampu itu tetap menyala sepanjang malam. Peraturan ini harus ditaati dari generasi ke generasi. Outside the curtain of the Very Holy Place, Aaron must take care of the lamps in my presence continually, in order that they will burn all during the night. That regulation must be obeyed forever.
\v 4 Dia harus terus menerus mengatur pelita-pelita itu di atas kaki-kakinya yang terbuat dari emas murni. Those lampstands that burn in my presence must be taken care of continually.
\p
\v 5 Selain itu, setiap minggu kalian harus membawa tepung terbaik untuk membakar dua belas roti yang sangat besar. Gunakanlah empat liter tepung untuk membuat satu roti yang besar. Also, \add each week\add* you must take some fine flour and bake twelve\add very big\add* loaves of bread, using about four quarts/liters of flour for each loaf.
\v 6 Taruhlah di hadapan-Ku dua deret roti besar di atas meja yang dilapisi dengan emas. Put the loaves in two rows, with six loaves in each row, on the table covered with pure gold, in my presence.
\v 7 Di sepanjang setiap deretan roti itu, isilah sedikit kemenyan ke dalam mangkuk emas untuk dibakar sebagai persembahan bagi-Ku menggantikan roti. Along each row, place \add in some gold cups\add* some pure incense to be burned to be an offering to me instead of the bread.[Ikuti CEV.]
\v 8 Roti yang segar harus ditaruh di atas meja setiap hari Sabat. Hal ini untuk mengingatkan perjanjian yang tidak akan pernah berakhir yang sudah Aku buat dengan umat Israel. New/Fresh loaves of bread must be put \add on the table\add* each Sabbath day, to signify the agreement that will never end, that I have made with you Israeli people.
\v 9 Roti itu menjadi bagian Harun dan putra-putranya. Mereka harus memakannya di tempat yang kudus karena roti itu adalah persembahan api-apian yang maha kudus yang dipersembahkan kepada-Ku. aThe bread \add that is taken off the table\add* belongs to Aaron and his sons. They must eat it in a holy place, because it is a very holy part of the offerings that are given to me by being burned.”
\s1 Hukuman yang....An example of fair punishment
\p
\v 10-11 Ada seorang laki-laki yang ibunya bernama Selomita; Wanita itu adalah orang Israel. Bapaknya bernama Dibri dari suku Dan. Bapak dari laki-laki itu berasal dari Mesir. Pada suatu hari, laki-laki itu dan laki-laki Israel lainnya mulai bertengkar di dalam kemah. Saat mereka bertengkar, laki-laki itu mengutuk TUHAN. uThere was a man whose mother's name was Shelomith; she was an Israeli whose father was Dibri from the tribe of Dan. And that man's father was from Egypt. One day that man and another Israeli man started to fight inside the camp. And while they were fighting, that man cursed Yahweh [MTY].
\v 12 So the Israeli people seized him and guarded him until they could find out what Yahweh would reveal to them\add that they should do to that man\add*.
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
\v 14 “\add Tie up and\add* take outside the camp the man who has cursed me. There all those who heard what he said must puttheir hands on his head \add to indicate that he is guilty\add*, and then all the people must\add kill him by throwing\add* stones at him.
\v 15 Tell the Israelis, ‘If anyone curses me, he must ◄endure the consequences/be punished►.
\v 16 So anyone who curses me [MTY] must be executed. All the people must throw stones at him. It does not matter if he is a foreigner or an Israeli citizen; anyone who curses me must be executed.’
\p
\v 17 Also, If anyone murders another person, he must be executed.
\v 18 And anyone who kills \add another person's\add* animal must give that person a live animal to replace the one that he killed.
\v 19 And if one person injures another person, the injured person is allowed to injure the person who injured him in the same way:
\v 20 If someone breaks one of another person's bones, that person is allowed to break one of the bones of the person who injured him. If someone gouges out an eye of another person, that person is allowed to gouge out the eye of the person who injured him. If someone knocks out the tooth of another person, that person is allowed to knock out one of his teeth. What is done to the offender must be the same as what he did to the other person.
\v 21 Whoever kills \add another person's\add* animal must give that person a live animal to replace the one that he killed, but anyone who murders another person must be executed.
\v 22 You Israelis and foreigners who live among you must have that same law; I, Yahweh your God\add am the one who has commanded it\add*.”
\p
\v 23 Then Moses/I told the Israelis \add what they must do to the man who cursedYahweh\add*, so they took the man outside the camp and \add killed him bythrowing\add* stones at him. They did what Yahweh commanded Moses/me\add to tell them to do\add*.
