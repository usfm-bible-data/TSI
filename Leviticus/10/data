\s1 TUHAN menghukum mati Nadab dan Abihu
\p
\v 1 Pada suatu hari, kedua anak Harun yang bernama Nadab dan Abihu, masing-masing mengambil tempat pembakaran dan [menyalakan//menaruh] api di atasnya. Lalu meletakkan dupa di atas api itu dan mempersembahkannya kepada TUHAN. TUHAN tidak [menerima//menyetujui] persembahan mereka itu karena cara yang mereka buat tidak sama seperti yang TUHAN perintahkan.
\v 2 Tiba-tiba muncullah api dari TUHAN, menghanguskan mereka berdua dan matilah mereka di hadapan TUHAN.
\v 3 Kemudian Musa berbicara kepada Harun, “Inilah yang TUHAN maksud waktu Dia berfirman, ‘Semua yang melayani Aku, harus menghormati kekudusan-Ku. Di hadapan semua masyarakat Israel, Aku harus memperlihatkan [keagungan//kebesaran]-Ku kepada seluruh [masyarakat//rakyat] pilihan-Ku’” Tetapi Harun hanya diam dan tidak berbicara apa pun.
\q1 ‘Para imam yang melayani Aku,
\q2 Aku akan memperlihatkan [keagungan//kebesaranku] kepada mereka, supaya mereka menjaga kekudusan-Ku.
\q1 di hadapan seluruh [masyarakat//rakyat] Israel
\q2 Akulah satu-satunya yang harus dihormati.’”
\m Tetapi Harun tidak berbicara apa pun.
\p
\v 4 Kemudian Musa memanggil Misael dan Elisafan, “Mari, angkat dan bawalah mayat kedua saudara sepupumu itu keluar dari [Rumah TUHAN//tempat yang kudus] ini dan letakkanlah mereka di luar perkemahan.” Misael dan Elsafan adalah anak-anak Uziel, paman Harun.
\v 5 Lalu Misael dan Elsafan membawa kedua mayat itu yang masih berpakaian kemeja putih ke luar perkemahan, seperti yang diperintahkan oleh Musa kepada mereka.
\p
\v 6 Kemudian Musa berbicara kepada Harun dan kedua anaknya, Eleazar dan Itamar, “Janganlah kalian bersedih dan berdukacita dengan cara mengoyakkan pakaian kalian dan tidak menyisir rambut kalian karena kematian yang menimpa Nadab dan Abihu. Kalau kalian berdukacita, kalian pasti mati dan semua masyarakat Israel juga akan kena marah dari TUHAN. Biarkanlah seluruh masyarakat Israel bersedih dan berdukacita untuk menangisi mereka berdua yang mati karena dibakar oleh TUHAN dengan api.
\v 7 Kalian tidak boleh meninggalkan Rumah TUHAN supaya kalian jangan mati. Karena kalian sudah [ditahbiskan//diurapi//disahkan] dengan minyak urapan untuk melayani TUHANBut you must not leave the entrance of the Sacred Tent \add to join those who aremourning\add*, because if you do that, you also will die, and Yahweh will punish [MTY] all the people of Israel. Do not forgetthat Yahweh has set you apart [MTY] to work for him here, \add and he does not want you to become defiled by touching acorpse\add*.” So they did what Moses/I told them to do.
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron,
\v 9 “You and your \add two\add* sons \add who are still alive\add* must not drink wine or other fermented drinks before you enter the sacred tent; if you do that, you will die. That is a command that you and your descendants must obey forever.
\v 10 You must do that in order to learn what things are holy and what things are ◄not holy/common►, and\add from the things that are not holy\add* you must learn what things are acceptable to me and what things are not.
\v 11 And you must teach to the Israeli people all the laws that I gave to the Israeli people by telling them to Moses.”
\p
\v 12 Moses/I said to Aaron and his two sons who were still alive, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the offering made from grain that is left after a portion of it has been offered to Yahweh to be burned, and eat it alongside the altar.\add It should not be eaten elsewhere\add* because it is very holy.
\v 13 Eat it in a holy place; it is the share for you and your sons from the offerings that were burned; I have commanded that it be your share.
\v 14 But you and your sons and daughters are permitted to eat the breast and the thigh that were lifted up in front of Yahweh. Eat them in any place that is ◄holy/acceptable to him►. They have been given to you and your descendants as your share of theofferings to enable the Israelis to maintain fellowship \add withYahweh\add*.
\v 15 The thigh and the breast that were lifted up in front of Yahweh must be brought with the portions of fat to be burned, to be lifted up in his presence. They will be the regular share for you and your descendants, as Yahweh has commanded.”
\p
\v 16 When Moses/I inquired about the goat that had been sacrificed to enable the people to be forgiven by Yahweh for the sins they had committed, he/I found out that it had been completely burned. So he/I was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar and asked them,
\v 17 “Why did you not eat near the Sacred Tent the meat of the offering for sin? It was very holy, and it was given to you to enable the Israeli people to no longer be guilty for their sins and to be forgiven for their sins.
\v 18 Since its blood was not taken into the holy place inside the Sacred Tent, you should have eaten the\add meat of\add* the goat near the Sacred Tent, as I commanded.”
\p
\v 19 Aaron replied to Moses/me, “Today the people brought to Yahweh their offering to be forgiven for the sins they hadcommitted, and the offering to be completely burned, \add and surely that pleasedYahweh\add*, but \add think about\add* the \add terrible thing\add* that happened to my other two sons! Would [RHQ] Yahweh have been pleased if I had eaten some of the offering to cause the people to become acceptable to God?”
\v 20 When Moses/I heard that, he/I was satisfied.
