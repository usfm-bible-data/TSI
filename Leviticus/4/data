\s1 Korban Penghapus Dosa
\p
\v 1 Lalu TUHAN berkata kepada Musa,
\v 2 "Katakanlah kepada orang-orang Israel: Jika seseorang tidak sengaja berbuat dosa, yaitu melakukan sesuatu yang dilarang oleh TUHAN.
\p
\v 3 Jika Imam yang telah diurapi berdosa, dan itu menyebabkan semua umat berdosa, dia harus mempersembahkan seekor lembu jantan muda yang tidak memiliki cacat kepada TUHAN. Itu akan menjadi korban untuk menghapus dosa yang telah dilakukannya.
\v 4 Ia harus membawa lembu jantan itu ke pintu masuk ke Kemah Suci. Dia harus meletakkan tangannya di atas kepala korban itu, lalu menyembelihnya di hadapan TUHAN dan meniriskan sebagian darahnya ke mangkuk.
\v 5 Kemudian imam harus membawa sebagian darah itu ke dalam Kemah Suci.
\v 6 Dia harus mencelupkan salah satu jari-jarinya ke dalam darah dan memercikkannya tujuh kali di hadapan TUHAN, di depan tirai yang memisahkan ruang kudus dan ruang maha kudus!.
\v 7 Kemudian ia harus menaruh sebagian darah itu di atas mezbah di mana ukupan harum dibakar di dalam Kemah Suci di hadapan TUHAN. Sisa darah lembu jantan yang masih ada di dalam mangkuk itu harus di curahkan ke dasar mezbah, tempat korban dibakar, di pintu masuk kemah suci.
\v 8 Dari persembahan khusus itu ia harus memisahkan bagian-bagian ini: lemak yang menutupi isi perut lembu jantan itu dan yang melekat pada isi perut itu,
\v 9 ginjal dan lemak yang menutupinya di dekat otot punggung bagian bawah, dan lemak yang menutupi hati.
\v 10 Kemudian Imam itu harus membakar semuanya itu dimezbah korban bakaran. Itu sama seperti ketika lemak dikeluarkan dari binatang yang dikorbankan untuk memelihara persekutuan yang baik dengan ALLAH.
\v 11 Tapi semua bagian lain dari hewan itu yaitu kulitnya dan semua dagingnya yang lain, kepala, kakinya,isi perut dan kotorannya,
\v 12 harus di bawa ke luar perkemahan dan melemparkannya ke dalam api tempat yang dapat diterima oleh Yahweh, di mana abu dilemparkan, dan dia harus membakarnya di atas tumpukan abu..

\v 13 If all the Israeli people sin without intending to sin, doing something that is forbidden in any of Yahweh's commands, they will be guilty, even if they do not realize that they have sinned.
\v 14 When they realize that they have committed a sin, together they must bring a young bull to be an offering for their sin, to the front of the Sacred Tent.
\v 15 The elders must lay their hands on the bull's head in the presence of Yahweh and slaughter it\add and catch some of the blood in a bowl\add*.
\v 16 Then the Supreme [MTY] Priest must take some of that blood into the Sacred Tent.
\v 17 He must dip \add one of\add* his fingers into the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the presence of Yahweh, in frontof the curtain \add that separates the Holy Place from the Very HolyPlace\add*.
\v 18 Then he must put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar that is in the presence of Yahweh in the Sacred Tent. The remaining part of the bull's blood, he must pour out at the base of the altar where sacrifices are burned, at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
\v 19 He must remove all the animal's fat and burn it on the altar.
\v 20 He must do with this bull the same things that he did with the bull that was an offering for his own sins, and they will be forgiven {Yahweh will forgive them}.
\v 21 Then the priest must take the \add other parts of\add* the bull outside the camp and burn them, like he does when he himself has sinned. That will be the offering for the sin that all the people have committed, and they will be forgiven.
\p
\v 22 When one of the leaders sins without intending to sin, doing something that is forbidden in any of the commands of Yahweh his God, he will be guilty.
\v 23 When he realizes that he has committed a sin, he must bring as his offering a male goat that has no defects.
\v 24 He must lay his hands on the goat's head in the presence of Yahweh and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter{are slaughtered} the animals that will be completely burned \add on thealtar\add*. That will be an offering for his sin.
\v 25 Then the priest must put some of the animal's blood \add into abowl\add* and dip \add one of\add* his fingers in it and put some of the blood on the corners of the projections of the altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 26 Then he must burn all the fat on the altar, like was done with the fat of the offering to maintain good fellowship\add with Yahweh\add*. As a result of the priest's doing that, the leader will no longer be guilty for his sin and he will be forgiven.
\p
\v 27 If one of the Israeli people who is not a priest sins without intending to sin, and does something that is forbidden in any of the commands of Yahweh his God, he will be guilty.
\v 28 When he realizes that he has committed a sin, he must bring as his offering a female goat that has no defects.
\v 29 He must lay his hands on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the animals that will becompletely burned \add on the altar, and catch some of the blood in abowl\add*.
\v 30 Then the priest must dip \add one of\add* his fingers in it, and put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 31 Then he must remove all the goat's fat, and burn all the fat on the altar, like was done with the fat of the offering tomaintain fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh. As a result of the priest doing that, the person will no longer be guilty for his sin, and he will be forgiven.
\p
\v 32 If that person brings a lamb to be his offering for sin, he must bring a female lamb that has no defects.
\v 33 He must lay his hands on the lamb's head and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the animals that will becompletely burned \add on the altar, and catch some of the blood in abowl\add*.
\v 34 Then the priest must dip \add one of\add* his fingers in it and put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 35 Then he must remove all the lamb's fat, and burn all the fat on the altar, like was done with the fat of the offering tomaintain fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*. He must burn it on top of the other offerings to Yahweh that are being burned. As a result, the priest will request God to forgive that person for his sin, and he will be forgiven.‚Äù
